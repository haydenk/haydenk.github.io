## Scripture Reference(s)

* Acts 21
* Acts 22
* Acts 7
* Matthew 18:6
* Matthew 19:14
* Matthew 28:19–20
* Matthew 5:20
* Luke 15:11–32
* John 8:32
* Ephesians 2:1–10

* 2 Corinthians 4:4

* Genesis 12:2–3  

## Key Points

* Jesus reshaped history: attitudes toward children, women, education, science, medicine, and social ethics.  
* Acts 22: Paul’s defense in Aramaic; background under Gamaliel shows Jesus rescues rebels and the religious.  
* Parallel language links Paul’s speech (“Brothers and fathers…”) with Stephen’s in Acts 7, underscoring Paul’s change.  
* Christianity birthed hospitals, schools, literacy movements, and many Ivy-League universities.  
* Netflix embeds transgender ideology in children’s shows (Cocomelon, Transformers, Monster High); such episodes function as sermons that catechise children.  
* “After the Ball” (1987) detailed a media strategy—victim narrative, desensitization, vilifying churches—to normalize LGBT doctrine; present culture reflects its success.  
* Testimony ≠ biography; every believer’s story is a resurrection story (Eph 2).  
* Evangelism tool * BLESS: Begin with prayer, Listen, Eat, Serve, Share.  
* Parenting: calibrate consciences, classify media as road/trail/minefield, sustain parent-over-peer bonding; fathers called to be watchful (1 Cor 16:13–14).  
* Love people while destroying deceptive arguments (2 Cor 10:5); consider economic stewardship (canceling harmful platforms).

## Theological / Exegetical Points

* NT written in Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic—Acts 22 records Paul in Aramaic.  
* Gamaliel’s stature (Mishna) highlights Paul’s elite training.  
* Soreg inscription explains riot over Paul’s alleged Gentile companion (Acts 21).  
* “Kick against the goads” likely references Paul’s guilt over Stephen’s death.  
* Jesus’ warnings/protection of children (Matt 18:6; 19:14) shape Christian ethics.  
* Two ways to miss the Father—rebellion and religion (Luke 15; Matt 5:20).

## Interaction & Group Responses

* Light banter: date nights, hunting, nickname contest, hat giveaway.  
* Celebration of Carlos’s sermon; applause for “ordinary” testimonies.  
* Collective alarm at Netflix clips; resolve to protect children.

## Practical Applications

* Treat all media as discipleship; run “lie-detectors” after viewing.  
* Share Christ-centered stories using BLESS.  
* Parenting stages: cop (0–10), coach (11–18), consultant (adult).  
* Guard young children from “minefield” content; cultivate a biblically faithful, heteronormative home.  
* Spend money as a vote for the world you want; evaluate subscriptions.

## Prayer / Intercession Items

* Salvation for those captive to deceptive ideologies.  
* Spirit-empowered wisdom for parents; truth and love to fill children.  
* Strength for the church to stand firm, act in love, and protect the vulnerable.
