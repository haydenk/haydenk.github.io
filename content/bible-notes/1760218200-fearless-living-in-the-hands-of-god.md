## Introduction

* Pastor begins by greeting all campuses and online viewers, then poses a penetrating question: “What would you do if you weren’t afraid?”  
* Acknowledges common, paralyzing fears—rejection, failure, success, loneliness, financial entrapment, relational stagnation.  
* Sets the stage for Acts 23, continuing Lake Pointe's series on the life of Paul.

## Scripture Reference(s)

* Acts 23
* Acts 24
* 2 Timothy 1:7
* Joshua 1:9
* Proverbs 6:32
* Proverbs 29:25
* 1 Corinthians 15:55  

## Key Points / Exposition  

### 1. God Has Not Given a Spirit of Fear

* Quoting Paul’s prison letter to Timothy, the pastor emphasizes that fear and timidity are not heaven-sent; God gifts power, love, and self-discipline.  
* Healthy instinctual fears (fire, falling, loud noises) differ from the crippling “spirit of fear.”  
* Greek insight: hypostasis—“that which stands under, a foundation.” True confidence rests on a solid spiritual foundation.

### 2. Paul Before the Sanhedrin (Acts 23)

* Paul claims a clear conscience, is struck on the mouth by order of the high priest, reacts in frustration, then apologizes—revealing his humanity.  
* Masterful strategy: declares his Pharisee heritage and hope in the resurrection, igniting Pharisee–Sadducee debate and diverting attention.  
* Roman commander extracts Paul for safety; that night Jesus appears: “Take courage... you must testify in Rome.”  
* Lesson: divine encouragement often follows disappointment, assuring us our calling is not over.

### 3. Personal Testimony: Vegas to Kentucky

* Pastor recounts leaving a thriving Las Vegas church plant to return to his hometown, knowing conflict awaited.  
* God anchors him with Joshua 1:9; unsolicited cards and emails repeatedly quote the same verse, confirming the call.  
* Insight: Courage is forged in obedience, not circumstance.

### 4. Courage Defined: Potent + Present vs. Powerless

* Legitimate fear objects are both potent and present (e.g., a live poisonous snake).  
* Because of Christ’s resurrection, death is present but no longer potent—therefore illegitimate as a fear object (1 Cor 15).  
* Max Lucado quotation: when safety becomes our god, greatness is emasculated.

### 5. Fear of People: A Dangerous Trap

* Proverbs 29:25 warns that craving human approval ensnares; trusting the Lord brings safety.  
* Humorous “candy-store prom” story illustrates how people-pleasing alters behavior.  
* Call: let God’s acceptance eclipse public opinion.

### 6. A Survey of Courage in Acts (Chs 1–23)

* From Pentecost’s 120 Spirit-filled believers to Stephen, Philip, Ananias, Barnabas, Peter, and Paul—Acts showcases successive courageous acts.  
* Suggestion: reread Acts focusing solely on courage to see a pattern of Spirit-empowered boldness.

### 7. Everyday Courage: Rapid-Fire Reflections

* Pastor lists dozens of real-life scenarios—parenting, ministry transition, confronting abuse, entering rehab, teaching middle school, driving in Dallas—each demanding courage.
* Thread: Courage is mundane and majestic, public and private; all flows from surrender to God.

## Major Lessons & Revelations

* Courage springs from living consciously in God’s omnipotent, omnipresent hands.  
* Perfect love (God’s) expels fear; fear flourishes where divine love is doubted.  
* The greatest battlefield is internal—governing one’s spirit surpasses conquering a city.  
* Approval seeking is a subtle idol; reverence for God breeds true wisdom and bravery.  
* God often over-provides protection (470 soldiers for Paul) to remind us He’s got us.  

## Practical Application

1. Daily ask: “What would I attempt today if fear weren’t in charge?”  
2. Identify one current fear; bring it under Christ’s authority, replacing negative expectation with faith.  
3. Memorize 2 Tim 1:7 and Joshua 1:9; recite them whenever anxiety surfaces.  
4. Keep a journal of courage—record moments you obey despite fear, noting God’s faithfulness.  
5. Limit approval-seeking behaviors (e.g., social-media validation fast) to break people-pleasing cycles.  
6. Reread Acts 1–23 within a week, highlighting every act of courage; pray for similar boldness.

## Conclusion & Call to Response

The congregation is invited to sit quietly, let projected Scriptures wash over them, and ask God:  
“Lord, what courageous step are You asking of me? Where have I been paralyzed?”  
Jesus’ whispered assurance—“Take courage, I’m not done with you”—is extended to every listener.
