## Introduction  
*  Ice-breaker: everyone rated their fear of heights (0 - 10). The leader later tied this to “spiritual heights,” safety harnesses, and the assurance God gives in vv. 24-25.  
*  Session goal: finish the Jude series (week 5) by exploring vv. 20-25—how believers contend inwardly (vv. 20-21) and outwardly (vv. 22-23), and how God ultimately keeps them (vv. 24-25).

## Scripture Reference(s)  
* Jude 1:20–25  
* Romans 8:39  
* Luke 15:11–32  
* 1 Corinthians 15:33  
* John 14:15  

## Key Points  
1. Keep Yourselves in God’s Love (vv. 20-21)  
   *  Three participles define “keep”:  
     * Building yourselves up in the most holy faith (spiritual disciplines, fellowship, Scripture).  
     * Praying in the Holy Spirit.  
     * Waiting / hoping expectantly for Christ’s mercy at His return.  
   *  “Waiting” is active—ongoing obedience and hope, not idleness.  

2. Can We Leave God’s Love?  
   *  Tension discussed:  
     * Human responsibility (“keep yourselves”).  
     * Divine security (Rom 8:39; vv. 24-25).  
   *  Illustrations: Judas (rejecting), the Prodigal Son (rejecting yet still loved, Luke 15), and parental discipline. Conclusion: we can reject or wander from the enjoyment and benefits of God’s love, but nothing can sever His agapē toward His own.  

3. Outward Focus (vv. 22-23) - Three Groups, Three Responses  
   * a. “Those who doubt” → show mercy/compassion.  
   * b. “Others” in serious danger → snatch them from the fire (urgent intervention).  
   * c. Still others deeply corrupted → show mercy mixed with fear, hating even the garment stained by sin (maintain boundaries while loving).  
   *  Practical guideline: love everyone, yet exercise discernment and protective distance with persistent false teachers.  

4. Bad Company & Influence  
   *  1 Cor 15:33 cited; group agreed it is easier to be pulled down than to lift others up, especially in groups.  

5. Doxology (vv. 24-25)  
   *  God is “able to keep you from stumbling” and to “present you blameless with great joy.”  
   *  Four attributes praised: glory, majesty, power, authority—eternal and secured “through Jesus Christ our Lord.”  

## Theological / Exegetical Points  
* “Keep” (tēreō) is a command directed at believers; divine keeping (vv. 24-25) provides assurance without promoting complacency.  
* “Love” in vv. 21 and Rom 8:39 is agapē—unconditional, covenant love.  
* Action + Assurance: without harness (assurance) climbing ends in calamity; with harness but no climbing results in complacency. Both are necessary.  

## Interaction & Group Responses  
*  Fear-of-heights poll sparked laughter and set up the harness illustration.  
*  Mark’s original question (“If we must keep ourselves, can we fall out of God’s love?”) guided discussion.  
*  Multiple voices offered scriptures, analogies (crabs in a pot, Nehemiah’s sword & trowel, Jimmy Johnson’s Super Bowl speech).  
*  Consensus formed: grace is not a license to sin; it calls for disciplined, hope-filled living.  

## Practical Applications  
1. Daily disciplines (Word, prayer, fellowship) actively “build” faith.  
2. Practice hopeful expectancy—live today as though Christ could return tonight.  
3. Show tailored mercy: gentle with doubters, decisive with those in peril, cautious yet compassionate with the hardened.  
4. Guard close relationships; fellowship shapes character.  
5. Remember the “harness” of God’s keeping: strive confidently, not fearfully.
