## Introduction  
Pastors Josh and Paul (recording while Josh is on a family vacation at Gulf Shores) walk through Acts 23, share personal testimony on overcoming anxiety, and evaluate current cultural questions about abortion, capital punishment, and immigration—responding to recent comments from Pope Francis and a Seattle mayor.

## Scripture Reference(s)

* Acts 22–23
* Numbers 11
* Luke 12:11-12
* Joshua 1
* Galatians 6:11
* Romans 8:15
* Romans 13:1-7
* Genesis 9:6
* Psalm 101:8
* 1 Peter 5:7  

## Key Points  

1. Acts 23 Observations  
* Paul greets the Sanhedrin as “men and brothers,” asserting former equality as a Pharisee.  
* Sanhedrin split: Pharisees (Scripture-believing, supernaturalists) vs. Sadducees (Torah-only, no resurrection/angels).  
* Paul exploits this rift by declaring, “I am on trial concerning the hope of the resurrection,” fulfilling Luke 12:11-12 (Spirit-given words).  
* High-priest Ananias unlawfully orders Paul struck; Paul’s “white-washed wall” rebuke proved prophetic—Ananias was later assassinated (Josephus).  
* Possible reason Paul “didn’t know” the high priest: very poor eyesight (Gal 6:11).  
* Forty “Sicarii” take an oath to kill Paul; God thwarts the plot through Paul’s teenage nephew, demonstrating providence (“Day” - divine necessity theme in Luke-Acts).  
* 470 Roman soldiers escort Paul—evidence of God’s sovereign protection.

2. Fear & Faith  
* Faith does not eliminate fear; it overrides it.  
* Seven helps from Josh’s 2019 anxiety battle:  
  1. Saturating encouragement (“It won’t be this way forever” - Ps 27:13).  
  2. Confession—get hidden grief/sin/doubt out.  
  3. Wise, Christ-centered counseling.  
  4. Replace rumination with meditation on God’s works.  
  5. “The way out is through” - do the fearful task; faith muscle grows.  
  6. Honest, persistent prayer—peace that “surpasses understanding” requires surrendering the need to understand (Phil 4:6-7 idea).  
  7. Fix eyes on the cross—whatever the reason for suffering, it “cannot be that God doesn’t love me” (Rom 8:32).

3. Killing vs. Murder  
* 6th Commandment forbids murder (taking innocent life), not every instance of killing.  
* Genesis 9:6 grounds capital punishment in the Imago Dei.  
* Romans 13:4—state bears the sword as “God’s servant, an avenger who carries out wrath on the wrong-doer.”  
* Mercy to the guilty becomes cruelty to the innocent if the state abandons justice.

4. Abortion, Capital Punishment & Immigration - Keeping Categories Clear  
* Abortion: always the unjust taking of innocent life—non-negotiable for Christians.  
* Capital punishment: taking of guilty life, historically affirmed by church fathers (e.g., Aquinas, Calvin). Open to prudent debate on application/due process.  
* Immigration: no life is taken; Scripture commands personal compassion to sojourners while also affirming national borders (Nehemiah’s wall; Rom 13 duty to protect citizens). Policy details are prudential matters Christians may disagree on.  
* Chart used: three separate columns (rights due because of Imago Dei; historic church stance; room for policy debate).

5. Current Illustrations  
* Pope Francis’ claim that pro-life requires rejecting the death penalty conflates distinct issues.  
* Seattle mayor clip: prioritizing personal back-stories over public safety shows what happens when the state trades justice for unilateral empathy—“mercy to the guilty is cruelty to the innocent.”

## Theological / Exegetical Points  
* “Day” (δεῖ) in Luke-Acts = divine necessity driving events.  
* Providence: “Behind a frowning providence He hides a smiling face.”  
* Distinct God-ordained spheres: Family, Church, State—trouble arises when one sphere tries to do another’s job.  
* Cross-centered suffering: peace comes when the believer exchanges “Why?” for “What are You forming in me, Father?”

## Practical Applications  
* Memorize and pray Joshua 1:9 when fear rises.  
* Replace “What if…?” loops with “Remember when God…?” testimonies.  
* In civic engagement, uphold both compassion (individual calling) and justice/order (government calling).  
* Evaluate news claims (e.g., papal statements) against Scripture and historic Christian teaching.  
* Parents: model godly priorities—Josh stopped recording the moment his kids returned.

## Prayer / Intercession Items  
* Freedom for group members battling anxiety; deep assurance of the Father’s love.  
* Wisdom for governing authorities to wield the sword justly.  
* Courage for believers to speak truth with grace in cultural debates.  
* Protection and gospel fruit for persecuted churches (e.g., in Seattle).  

## Next Meeting / Future Arrangements  
* Lake Pointe’s upcoming series “Run to Win” (judgment & rewards, end-times themes) launches this weekend.
