## Introduction  
A panel of pastors and ministry leaders discussed the rapidly growing debate over “Christian nationalism.” They clarified definitions, corrected caricatures, examined biblical texts, cited America’s founding documents, answered common objections, and shared pastoral experiences—especially from strongly progressive regions—about why Christians should engage the public square without idolatry.

## Scripture Reference(s)

* Jeremiah 29:4–7
* Matthew 28:18–20
* Matthew 5:13–16
* Psalm 33:12
* Proverbs 29:2
* Romans 13:1–4
* Colossians 2:15
* 2 Thessalonians 3:6–12  

## Key Points  
* “Christian nationalism” (rightly defined) = Christians wanting the moral, cultural, and political life of their nation shaped by explicitly Christian principles.  
* It does NOT mean:  
  * equating America with the Kingdom of God  
  * forced conversion or a state-controlled church  
  * overturning the U.S. Constitution  
  * ignoring historic sins or refusing to repent of them.  
* Three governmental spans exist: tribalism, nationalism, globalism. Scripture depicts God affirming nations (Acts 17:26) while Babel (Gen 11) and the final Antichrist model globalism.  
* Power is morally neutral; its righteousness depends on who wields it (Prov 29:2). If godly people avoid power, the godless fill the vacuum.  
* Early America was overtly Christian: congressional prayers in Jesus’ name, Bible-based public-school curricula, the Aitken Bible funded by Congress, Sabbath and blasphemy laws, etc.  
* “Separation of church and state” appears in no founding document; the Establishment Clause limits Congress from creating a national church, not from allowing Christian influence.  
* Historical quotes (e.g., Adams, Washington, Patrick Henry) and 1850s House/Senate Judiciary statements affirm Christianity as the nation’s “conservative element.”  
* Modern objections (“exiles in Babylon,” “hurts our witness,” “both parties are equally bad,” “your eschatology won’t allow success”) are biblically and historically unsound.  
* Moral asymmetry: current U.S. party platforms are not equally aligned with biblical ethics (e.g., abortion, sexual ethics, religious liberty).  
* Pastors in strongly “blue” states testify that progressive policies tangibly hinder church mission and family flourishing.  
* Voting is a stewardship issue; in a republic each citizen is a fractional authority under God (Rom 13).  

## Theological / Exegetical Points  
1. Jeremiah 29:4-7 – God tells exiles to “seek the welfare of the city,” implying civic engagement even in pagan contexts.  

   “Thus says the LORD of hosts... ‘Seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the LORD on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare.’ ”  

2. Matthew 28:18-20 – The Great Commission targets “all nations,” requiring public discipleship.  

   “And Jesus came and said to them, ‘All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations... teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.’ ”  

3. Matthew 5:13-16 – Salt/light metaphors demand visible cultural influence.  

   “You are the salt of the earth... You are the light of the world... let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.”  

4. Psalm 33:12 – National blessing is tied to acknowledging the LORD.  

   “Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD, the people whom he has chosen as his heritage!”  

5. Proverbs 29:2 – Leadership righteousness directly affects public joy or groaning.  

   “When the righteous increase, the people rejoice, but when the wicked rule, the people groan.”  

6. Romans 13:1-4 – Government is “God’s servant”; servants must obey their Master’s moral law.  

   “Let every person be subject to the governing authorities... for he is God’s servant for your good... he does not bear the sword in vain.”  

7. Colossians 2:15 – Christ’s cross was an act of triumphal power, not capitulation.  

   “He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him.”  

8. 2 Thessalonians 3:6-12 – Expectation of Christ’s return must not produce civic idleness.  

   “If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat... do their work quietly and earn their own living.”  

## Interaction & Group Responses  
* Hosts laughed at media caricatures (“NAR Hawaiian prophet,” “January 6 buffalo horns”) but quickly disavowed extremism.  
* Strong pushback against straw-man definitions equating Christian nationalism with “idolizing Trump” or denying America’s sins.  
* Blue-state pastors (Seattle, WA; Wenatchee, WA) recounted assaults on churchgoers, doxxing, and legislative hostility as real-time evidence that governmental ideology matters for gospel ministry.  
* Reformed-leaning listeners asked whether only post-millennial eschatology justifies cultural optimism; response: all major views anticipate simultaneous gospel advance and rising iniquity (“dueling revivals”).  
* Some questioned why the panel “punches left”; answer: moral asymmetry and urgency demand louder critique where sin is enshrined.  

## Practical Applications  
* Register, vote, and evaluate platforms through a biblical lens; refusing to vote buries the “talent” of delegated authority.  
* Teach congregations the historic Christian roots of American liberty; inoculate them against revisionist history.  
* Engage local school boards, city councils, and state legislatures to keep laws from inviting God’s judgment.  
* Encourage balanced patriotism: love of country under love for Christ; gratitude without whitewashing national sins.  
* Pastors in red regions should learn from blue-state challenges and prepare congregations for future ideological pressure.  

## Prayer / Intercession Items  
* For national and local leaders to acknowledge Christ’s lordship and legislate righteously (1 Tim 2:1-4).  
* Protection and courage for churches ministering in hostile environments.  
* National repentance for legalized abortion and sexual confusion; revival that merges heart-change with policy change.  
* Wisdom for Christians holding public office to remain servants of God, not idols of power.
