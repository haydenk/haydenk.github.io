- States pastoral priority: preparing believers for eternity above all else.  
- Sets goal for message—clarify exactly what happens the moment after death and at Christ’s return.

## Scripture Reference(s)  
Romans 14:10-12; Revelation 20:11-15; 2 Corinthians 5:10; Matthew 7:21-23; Romans 1:16; 1 Corinthians 9:24-25; 1 Corinthians 3:13-14; Matthew 16:27; Revelation 22:12; 1 John 1:7; Psalm 51:1; Isaiah 43:25; Habakkuk 1:13

## Key Points / Exposition  

### 1. Everyone Faces Two Judgments  
- Scripture shows not one but two distinct judgments.  
  1) Great White Throne Judgment – “everybody” judgment (Revelation 20:11-15).  
  2) Judgment Seat (Bema) of Christ – rewards ceremony for believers (2 Corinthians 5:10).  
- Paul warns Christians not to focus on judging others because “we will all stand” before God (Romans 14:10-12).

### 2. The Great White Throne Judgment – “What Did You Do With Jesus?”  
- Vision: books (plural) and a single “Book of Life.”  
  - Books = exhaustive record of every deed—good and bad.  
  - Book = only names, no sins.  
- Illustration with permanent marker: our sins are indelibly written; good works or apologies cannot erase them.  
- Only the blood of Jesus can “blot out” transgressions (Psalm 51:1; Isaiah 43:25; 1 John 1:7).  
- Hell is ultimately the place where people choose to pay for their own sin instead of accepting Christ’s payment.  
- Correct answer on Judgment Day: “I gave my life to Jesus—I knew Him.”  
- Warning from Jesus (Matthew 7:21-23): many will rely on religious activity rather than relationship.

### 3. Personal Testimony – From Religion to Relationship  
- Pastor’s upbringing: constant church attendance, prayed prayer at 8 to avoid hell.  
- At 16, encounter in a charismatic church; Romans 1:16 awakens him to a living relationship with Christ.  
- Distinction between external religion (doll) and internal life (living child): only genuine faith saves.

### 4. The Judgment Seat of Christ – “What Did You Do With What I Gave You?”  
- Greek “Bema” imagery: Olympic officials rewarding victorious runners.  
- Believers’ works pass through a refining fire (1 Corinthians 3:13-14). Whatever survives receives eternal reward.  
- Jesus is eager to reward (Matthew 16:27; Revelation 22:12).  
- Life resources—time, talents, finances, nationality, era—are stewardship trusts.

### 5. What Lasts Forever  
- Only one category endures the fire: the souls of people.  
- Believers can’t change the whole world but can change someone’s world by leveraging their resources for eternal impact.

### 6. Modern Example – Lewis & Casey’s Foster Journey  
- Video testimony: infertility led couple to pray and attend Lake Point’s Foster & Adoption Conference.  
- Turned painful past and personal experience with the system into redemptive ministry for children.  
- Demonstrates using life story and resources to make eternal difference in others.

## Major Lessons & Revelations  
- Death is certain; preparation is optional but essential.  
- Salvation hinges on relationship with Jesus, not religious résumé.  
- Eternal rewards are real and tied to how believers steward God-given resources for people’s salvation and welfare.  
- God delights to erase sin, rename believers, and celebrate their faithful service.

## Practical Application  
1. Examine relationship with Christ—move from knowing about Him to knowing Him.  
2. Place faith in Jesus’ finished work; stop trying to self-erase sin.  
3. Inventory resources (skills, finances, influence, time) and ask, “How can these reach or serve people for eternity?”  
4. Engage in ministries that touch eternal souls—e.g., foster care, missions, evangelism, discipling the next generation.  
5. Live daily with the Bema Seat in view—run the faith-race to win imperishable rewards (1 Corinthians 9:24-25).

## Conclusion & Call to Response  
- Two unavoidable questions await every person:  
  1) “What did you do with Jesus?”  
  2) “What did you do with what I gave you?”  
- Pastor urges congregation to settle the first by surrendering to Christ today and to orient life toward the second by investing in people who will last forever.
