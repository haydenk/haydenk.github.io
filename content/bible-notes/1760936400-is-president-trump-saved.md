> 1 Corinthians 9:24–27  
> “Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it. Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable. So I do not run aimlessly; I do not box as one beating the air. But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified.”  

> Hebrews 12:1–2  
> “Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith…”

## Key Points  
* Absence of God in a culture elevates government to “god-status.”  
* Death is certain; Satan’s ancient lie “you will not surely die” keeps people from preparing for judgment (Heb 9:27).  
* Two judgments for humanity:  
  * Believers – commendation/rewards (Bēma seat).  
  * Unbelievers – condemnation (Great White Throne).  
* Scripture teaches varying degrees of reward in heaven (1 Cor 3:12-15) and punishment in hell (Luke 12:47-48; Matt 11:21-24).  
* Christians run a unique, God-marked race; comparison distracts (illustrated by Michael Phelps photo).  
* Athletic metaphors dominate the New Testament because discipline, focus, and sacrifice mirror discipleship.  
* Rich Froning’s testimony: a 2010 CrossFit loss exposed misplaced identity, drove him to Romans study, baptism (Gal 6:14), daily Scripture, and outspoken faith.  
* His “faith–family–fitness–service” rule and nightly self-assessment keep priorities aligned.  
* Adoption story: three children adopted after infertility; courtroom experience pictures Romans 8:15 (“Spirit of adoption”).  
* Practical motto from bison behavior: “Into the storm”—face trials, don’t flee (James 1:2-4; Rom 5:3-5).  
* Evangelism posture: authentic relationship over preachiness; be the church outside church walls.

## Theological / Exegetical Points  
1. Judgment Frameworks  
   * Dispensational view: multiple end-time judgments (Bēma after rapture; national, sheep-goats, Great White Throne).  
   * Covenant view: single final judgment with distinct outcomes for believers/unbelievers.  
2. Degrees of Accountability – Luke 12:47-48  
   “That servant who knew his master’s will…will receive a severe beating, but the one who did not know…will receive a light beating. Everyone to whom much was given, of him much will be required.”  
3. National Light & Responsibility – Matthew 11:21-24  
   Jesus warns Chorazin, Bethsaida, Capernaum that their greater revelation makes future judgment “less tolerable” for notorious OT cities. Concern applied to modern America.  
4. Salvation by Grace – Ephesians 2:8-9  
   “For by grace you have been saved through faith…not a result of works, so that no one may boast.”  

## Interaction & Group Responses  
* Hosts recall personal “rope-climb” failures and how setbacks deepen faith.  
* Visual aids: World-Series home-plate celebration (Heb 12 cloud of witnesses); Olympic swimmer photo to show focus on own lane.  
* Group laughs over Rich’s memes and friendly push-up contest (Rich 37, Josh 33, Carlos bowed out).  
* Audience invited to vote on Paul’s nickname (“Epistle Missile” vs. “Chat G-Paul-C”).  
* Chat thread encouraged to leave podcast reviews; hats given away to commenters.

## Practical Applications  
1. Build “grace-driven effort” habits: consistent Scripture intake, prayer, generosity, physical stewardship.  
2. Nightly audit: How did I invest in (a) faith, (b) family, (c) fitness/service today? Short memory on wins and failures—start fresh tomorrow.  
3. Face storms—choose hard obedience now to finish well later.  
4. Share faith naturally: worship music during workouts, invite discussion, live transparently.  
5. Consider adoption/foster care as living parable of the gospel.  
6. Pray for government leaders to humble themselves before God; our nation needs higher authority than the state.

## Prayer / Intercession Items  
* Thank God for 2,500+ baptisms at Lake Pointe this year—ask for 3,000.  
* Salvation of national leaders; President Trump to move from “God-fearer” to faith in Christ.  
* Courage for believers to run their unique race and resist comparison.  
* Endurance for those in trials; may suffering produce character and hope (Rom 5:3-5).  
* Strength for adoptive families; protection and provision for crisis-pregnancy ministries.

## Next Meeting / Future Arrangements  
* Continue “Run to Win” series: upcoming messages on storing treasure in heaven.  
* Podcast listeners: text “NOTES” to 2041 or visit lakepoint.church/shownotes for weekly discipleship guide.
