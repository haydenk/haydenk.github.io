## Introduction  
* Guest preacher: Ernest Smith, Lead Pastor of Front Range Church (Castle Rock, CO), a Lake Pointe church-plant (2013).  
* Ernest recounts Lake Pointe’s partnership, highlighting the Strategic Launch Network and personal support from Pastors Steve & Josh.  
* Sets the stage by confessing a lifelong struggle with comparison and the cultural pressure to “be successful.”  
* Central tension: God’s definition of success vs. our drive for status, wealth, and control.

* How God re-defines achievement through Naaman’s healing and our own obedience.

## Scripture References  
* 2 Kings 5:1–15  
* 1 Kings 22:34–40  
* Romans 6:23  

## Key Points / Exposition  

### 1. Naaman: Acclaimed Yet Incomplete  
* Background (2 Kings 5:1): Commander of Aram, victorious, wealthy, favored—yet afflicted with leprosy.  
* His name means “pleasant”; described as a “man of valor.”  
* Lesson: Earthly accolades cannot cure the deepest need; there is always a “but” that human success cannot fix.

### 2. An Unnamed Servant Girl: Faithful in Captivity  
* Captured Israeli teen suggests Naaman visit the prophet Elisha (v. 3).  
* Demonstrates:  
  * Kingdom influence is not bound by circumstance or status.  
  * God often advances His plans through overlooked, ordinary obedience.  

### 3. The Clash of Expectations  
* Naaman arrives with (a) a royal letter and (b) ~\$7.5 million in gifts, assuming healing can be bought.  
* Elisha refuses to meet him personally; sends instructions through a servant—bathe seven times in the muddy Jordan (vv. 9–10).  
* Naaman’s anger: affront to his dignity; “better rivers in Damascus” (v. 12).  
* Exposure of an idol: “Success must be maintained; respect is owed to me.”

### 4. Success as a Modern Idol  
* Quotes: Tim Keller on achievement making us feel like gods.  
* Contemporary testimonies—Tom Brady, A.J. Brown, Mike Tyson—prove fame/money don’t satisfy.  
* Diagnostic questions: Whom do you deem “successful”? Where are you striving to maintain image, income, or control?

### 5. The Jordan Decision: Practicality vs. Simplicity  
* Command sounds illogical and too easy, mirroring the scandal of the gospel.  
* Parallel drawn:  
  * Our “spiritual leprosy” = sin.  
  * Only Christ’s cross and resurrection cleanse (Romans 6:23).  
  * Many stumble because grace feels “too simple.”

### 6. True Success = Surrender  
* Naaman finally obeys, is healed, and confesses, “Now I know there is no God in all the earth except in Israel” (v. 15).  
* Application: release control—careers, finances, marriages, children, health—so God can act.  
* Ernest’s testimony: Wife’s workplace trauma, lost income, mental/emotional battle; God provided healing, ministry fruit, and financial supply once they opened their hands.

## Major Lessons & Revelations  
* Earthly success is fragile and enslaving; it must be dismantled or it will collapse.  
* God esteems faithfulness over fame; He often works through anonymous servants.  
* Obedience precedes understanding; miracles follow humility.  
* The gospel’s power lies in its simplicity—receive, don’t achieve.  
* Real success is living inside God’s will, trusting His control, and reflecting His glory.

## Practical Application  
1. Identify the area you’re striving to control (career, image, wealth, relationships). Physically open your hands in daily prayer, releasing it to God.  
2. Resist comparison: celebrate others’ victories; remember your calling.  
3. Serve where you are—like the captive girl—trusting God to multiply small faithfulness.  
4. Share the gospel’s simple cure for sin; don’t complicate what Christ finished.  
5. Participate in generous mission giving (Annual Missions Offering) to advance kingdom work beyond your reach.

## Conclusion & Call to Response  
* Invitation to surrender idols of success and trust Christ for cleansing.  
* Call for first-time or returning faith commitments.  
* Challenge to give above and beyond through the Annual Missions Offering, fueling church plants and global partners.

## Prayer  
“Father, we open our hands—take our careers, marriages, finances, health, and prodigal children. Replace our idol of success with Your peace. We trust Your goodness and power; do what only You can do. Heal, restore, and use us for Your glory. In Jesus’ name, Amen.”
