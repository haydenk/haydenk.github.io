## Introduction  
Ice-breaker question: “Which is harder to deal with—trials or temptations?” The group used personal experience to compare the two and set the stage for studying James 1:12-15.

## Scripture Reference(s)  
James 1:12 - 15  

> 12 Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him.  
> 13 When tempted, no one should say, “God is tempting me.” For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone;  
> 14 but each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed.  
> 15 Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.  (NIV)

## Key Points  
* Opinions on what is harder  
  * Caleb & Jeremy: Temptations—surface in areas of weakness, often when alone.  
  * Chris, Charles, Tony & several others: Trials—uncontrollable, length unknown.  
  * Noted interplay: a temptation can start a trial, and trials can carry new temptations (reiterated).  

* Distinguishing trials from temptations  
  * Trials: allowed by the Father to strengthen faith.  
  * Temptations: sourced in the enemy and in our own desires, aiming to destroy.  

* “Crown of life” (v. 12)  
  * Agreed primary meaning: ultimate salvation.  
  * Present benefit discussed: living out one’s God-given purpose brings joy and blessing.  
  * Purpose (universal: love God & neighbour) vs. calling (individual service) clarified.  

* When is resisting temptation easier?  
  * Good times: anchored in Christ, community support (Rich, Steven).  
  * Trials: heightened dependence on God, vigilance (others).  
  * Warning: success can breed pride; lows can breed despair—both can open doors.  

* Process of temptation in vv. 13-15  
  1. Inevitable (“when tempted”).  
  2. Never from God—He is incapable of evil.  
  3. External lure (entice) meets internal evil desire.  
  4. Conception → sin → death.  

* Dietrich Bonhoeffer quote highlighted: temptation makes us forget God rather than hate Him.  

* Analogy of human conception applied to spiritual life:  
  * Abstinence (avoidance) is surer than “barriers” or hoping to “get lucky.”  
  * Practical abstinence equals purposeful distance from triggers and active pursuit of God’s will.  

## Theological / Exegetical Points  
* God’s holiness: He cannot tempt, nor be tempted internally.  
* Jesus’ wilderness temptation was external; His divine nature remained untainted.  
* Temptation itself is not sin; sin begins when desire and enticement unite.  
* Works are evidence of genuine faith (faith without works is dead).  

## Interaction & Group Responses  
* Scripture and life stories used: Peter’s denial during trial vs. Judas’ fall at a high point; David & Bathsheba; Saul sparing Amalekite spoils.  
* Honest self-assessment: several men admitted past failures arose during seasons of success.  
* Practical workplace example: speaking up against coarse talk; sometimes met with resistance (“Why are you judging me?”).  

## Practical Applications  
* Cultivate a teachable posture—“quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger.”  
* Obey what God reveals; hearing without doing is self-deception.  
* Stay close to God in all seasons (prayer, Word, community) to starve sinful desire.  
* Establish physical/accountability barriers before the lure appears.  
* Engage actively in one’s calling; purposeful Kingdom service redirects energy and affections.
