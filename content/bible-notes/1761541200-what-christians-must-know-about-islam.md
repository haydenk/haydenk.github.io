## Introduction  
The group reviewed Pastor Ernest’s sermon on Naaman (2 Kings 5), discussed pride and humility, addressed whether Christians should take part in Halloween, and considered Islam’s theological and political claims in light of Scripture and current events (New York mayoral race, Nigerian persecution).

## Scripture References  
2 Kings 5; Matthew 18:3; Isaiah 65:5; Romans 10:9; John 3:16; 1 Corinthians 8; Romans 14; Galatians 1:8; John 16:2; 1 Timothy 2:5–6; Revelation 20:4; Ephesians 5:11; 1 John 4:1; Matthew 5:14

## Key Points  
- Archaeological find (Assyrian cuneiform, ca. 700 BC) reinforces biblical history—“The Bible really happened.”  
- Naaman: powerful Syrian general, incurable leprosy, humbled by obeying Elisha, washed seven times in the Jordan, confessed the God of Israel alone is God.  
- Humility theme: God “opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.” Pride must be crucified, not managed.  
- Five humble phrases:  
  1. “I was wrong—will you forgive me?”  
  2. “Will you help me?”  
  3. Heart-felt praise to God.  
  4. “Thank you.”  
  5. “How can I bless you?”  
- Halloween: three-way grid—Receive, Reject, Redeem (1 Cor 8; Romans 14). Christians differ; never violate conscience, never bind another’s. Believers must reject occult darkness yet may redeem the day for gospel hospitality.  
- Islam: political ideology cloaked as religion; historical program of conquest; prophecy roots (Ishmael vs. Isaac, Gen 16); birth of Islam via “angel of light” (Gal 1:8). Distinct from Christianity on Trinity, incarnation, atonement (1 Tim 2:5–6).  
- Persecution: since 2009, 62 000+ Nigerian Christians martyred; global beheading motif (Rev 20:4).  
- Hope: unprecedented numbers of Muslims seeing “the Man in White” in dreams and trusting Christ (Acts 2:17 fulfilled).  

## Theological / Exegetical Points  
1. Leprosy as outward sign of inward uncleanness; Jesus reverses the Old-Testament flow—His touch makes the unclean clean.  
2. Naaman’s request for Israeli soil reflects ancient belief in territorial gods; Yahweh alone rules “hills and valleys.”  
3. Baptism typology: great man enters dirty water, rises “like a little child” (cf. Matthew 18:3).  
4. Isaiah 65:5 highlights God’s revulsion at pride:  
 “ …who say, ‘Keep to yourself, do not come near me, for I am holier than you!’ These are a smoke in my nostrils, a fire that burns all the day.”  
5. Salvation text (Romans 10:9) linked to Naaman’s confession.  
6. Core gospel:  
 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.” (John 3:16)  

### Full Texts Quoted in Session  
- Matthew 18:3  
 “Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.”  
- 1 Timothy 2:5–6  
 “For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all.”  
- John 16:2  
 “…the hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God.”  
- Galatians 1:8  
 “But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed.”  
- Ephesians 5:11  
 “Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them.”  
- 1 John 4:1  
 “Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God…”  
- Matthew 5:14  
 “You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.”  

## Interaction & Group Responses  
- Members marveled at humility of Naaman’s captive servant girl—“true hero.”  
- Several shared personal “Jordan River” moments of surrender.  
- Debate: some families fully avoid Halloween; others host outreach nights. Consensus: respect consciences, shine light.  
- Prayerful concern voiced for Nigerian believers; group felt stirred to intercede.  

## Practical Applications  
- Crucify pride daily; practice the five humble phrases this week.  
- Parents: guide costume choices away from occult themes; consider using 31 Oct for neighbor outreach (fire-pit, candy, gospel invites).  
- Engage Muslims with genuine love while clearly presenting Christ as sole mediator.  
- Stay informed about persecuted church; support agencies like Open Doors.  
- Develop a biblically shaped political theology—seek policies that preserve religious liberty and human dignity.  

## Prayer / Intercession Items  
1. Humility in every member’s heart; death to pride.  
2. Salvation of Muslim friends, neighbors, and global seekers seeing “the Man in White.”  
3. Protection and comfort for Nigerian Christians; justice against genocidal violence.  
4. Wise, courageous witness during Halloween; opportunities to share Christ.  
5. Global church to walk in unity, testing every spirit and exposing darkness.
