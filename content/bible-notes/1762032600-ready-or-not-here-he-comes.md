## Introduction  
* Pastor begins with lighthearted remarks about arriving “disheveled” after family soccer and cheer events, then quickly shifts: no sleepy listeners—today is about the return of Jesus.  
* Series theme: “Run to Win” (1 Cor 9)—races have a finish line; believers must live in view of the end.  
* Hide-and-seek illustration with his children: escalating count and the shout “Ready or not, here I come!” parallels Christ’s escalating signs and certain return.

## Key Points / Exposition  

### 1. Jesus Is Coming  
* Revelation 22:12 first declaration: “Look, I am coming.”  
* Wedding imagery (John 14:3) explained through 1st-century Jewish customs:  
  * Groom negotiates a mohar (bride-price) with the father—Christ paid the ultimate price at the cross.  
  * Groom departs to prepare an addition onto his father’s house—“In My Father’s house are many rooms.”  
  * Bride lives in expectancy; the father decides the moment of return; a trumpet (shofar) announces the groom.  
  * Church = Bride; Jesus = Groom; Father alone sets the day; trumpet (1 Cor 15:52) will signal His appearing.  

### 2. Jesus Is Coming Soon  
* Revelation 22:12 second declaration: “I am coming soon.”  
* Unknown day/hour (Matthew 24:36): even angels and the Son do not know—only the Father.  
* Purpose of secrecy: discourages idleness, encourages perpetual readiness (“If you stay ready, you don’t have to get ready”).  
* Believers must avoid divisive speculations over timelines (pre-trib, post-mill, etc.) and unite on the indisputable fact of His return.  

#### Signs of the Season (Spiritual “Contractions”)  
1. Increase in travel (Daniel 12:4) – from horseback distances to global air travel within hours.  
2. Explosion of knowledge (Daniel 12:4) – information now doubling every two months (AI age).  
3. Global live-stream capability (Revelation 11:9) – technology allows every tribe to witness the same event simultaneously.  
4. Movement toward a one-world economic system (Revelation 13:16-17) – digital IDs, CBDCs, global agencies foreshadow commerce control.  
5. Rise in Christian persecution (Matthew 24:9) – historic high in martyrdom; Nigerian believers cited.  
6. Mass apostasy (2 Thessalonians 2:3) – cultural “falling away,” seeker-sensitive drift, churches compromising truth.  
7. Rebirth of Israel as a nation (May 14 1948) – prophetic prerequisite fulfilled.  
8. Gospel preached to all nations (Matthew 24:14) – still in progress; fuels missionary urgency.  
9. Mount of Olives to split (Zechariah 14:3-5; Ezekiel 44) – geological fault line discovered; East Gate sealed by Suleiman yet destined to open at Christ’s arrival.  

### 3. His Reward Is With Him  
* Revelation 22:12 third declaration: He will “give to each person according to what they have done.”  
* Distinction: Salvation is free; rewards are earned.  
* Parable of the Talents: faithfulness versus laziness (Matthew 25).  
* Ways rewards are stored:  
  * Enduring persecution for righteousness.  
  * Deeds done in secret for God’s glory.  
  * Generosity to the poor and powerless.  
  * Evangelism—bringing the lost to Christ.  
* Goal: Hear “Well done, good and faithful servant,” not merely “Well, you’re done.”  
* Delay of Christ’s coming explained (2 Peter 3:9): God’s patience secures one more day, one more soul.

## Major Lessons & Revelations  
* Christ’s return is certain, imminent, and personal.  
* God withholds the date to cultivate daily holiness and mission.  
* Global, cultural, and technological shifts align with biblical prophecy, intensifying expectancy.  
* Earthly choices carry eternal consequences; believers will experience varying degrees of heavenly reward.  

## Practical Application  
* Live in a continual state of readiness—daily prayer, repentance, and obedience.  
* Refuse speculation that breeds division; focus on gospel proclamation and holy living.  
* Cultivate courage: expect hatred, prepare for persecution, remain faithful.  
* Invest in secret service, generosity, and global missions; give where return is eternal.  
* Discern worldly systems—maintain allegiance to Christ over any governing power.  

## Conclusion & Call to Response  
Pastor urges listeners: “Ready or not, here He comes.” Examine your life: Are you hiding from God or welcoming His appearing? Receive Christ’s salvation, join His mission, and run your race to win the eternal prize.
