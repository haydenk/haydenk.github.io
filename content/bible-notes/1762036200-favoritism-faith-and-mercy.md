## Introduction  
* Recap of James 1: external trials require internal, Spirit-formed responses (“listen and do,” “quick to listen, slow to anger”).  
* Transition: James now moves from the general (chapter 1) to specific conduct issues—first up, favoritism in the church.

## Scripture References  
James 1:15; James 2:1-13  
Matthew 5 (Beatitudes / Sermon on the Mount); Matthew 19:24  
Luke 10:25-37 (Good Samaritan)  
Leviticus 19:18 (quoted, “Love your neighbor as yourself”)  

## Key Points  
1. James 1:15 reviewed - sin’s progression: desire → sin → death (Cain parallel).  
2. James 2:1 - command: “Believers… must not show favoritism.”  
   * Working definition offered: valuing certain people over others.  
3. Reasons we show favoritism (class input):  
   * Pride, comfort, prejudice (appearance, dress, wealth, tats, religion, age, orientation).  
   * Self-interest: “people who can help me.”  
4. First-century setting: Near-caste society—extremely rich & extremely poor often attended same gatherings.  
5. Modern parallels: How would Lake Pointe treat a Lexus-driver vs. homeless visitor? First 17 seconds of contact decide return visit.  
6. Business illustration (Kyle’s dad selling power-sports): legitimizing “discrimination” for profit vs. kingdom ethics.  
7. Royal Law (James 2:8) = Jesus’ greatest-commandment summary “Love your neighbor as yourself.”  
8. Violation seriousness (2:9-11): favoritism = sin on par with adultery or murder—break one part, break the whole law.  
9. Root issue identified by group: lack of faith/trust in God as provider (money, comfort, protection).  
10. Judgment & mercy (2:12-13):  
    * believers will still face divine evaluation; absence of mercy toward people brings stricter judgment (“mercy triumphs over judgment”).  
    * Open question left for future study: Is this a matter of salvation or reward? Posture of the heart vs. isolated incidents.  

## Theological / Exegetical Points  
* “Royal law” unique phrase—highlights Jesus as King and His ethic as supreme.  
* James echoes Sermon on the Mount repeatedly; poverty, meekness, mercy connect to Beatitudes.  
* Eye-of-needle text (Mt 19:24) raised to question courting the wealthy for church funding; consensus: trust God, not donors.  

## Interaction & Group Responses  
* Ice-breaker: “Lunch with a pastor, felon, illegal immigrant, PhD, or CEO—who & why?”  
  * Answers revealed personal values (impact evangelism, brokenness stories, leadership insight).  
* Multiple men shared dealership / sales anecdotes illustrating snap judgments.  
* Debate: “Healthy discernment” vs. sinful favoritism—where is the line when protecting family or stewarding time?  
* Class concurred they commit this sin “daily” or “15,000 times a day,” often unconsciously.  

## Practical Applications  
* Examine heart posture each time you meet someone new—ask, “Am I loving a neighbor or leveraging a contact?”  
* Pair every “pour-into-me” meeting with one where you pour into someone else (rough 1:1 ratio suggested).  
* Learn & use names of marginalized attenders (example: two homeless regulars in café).  
* Greeters / parking-lot volunteers: remember visitors decide within seconds if they’ll return.  
* Pray for Holy Spirit discernment to balance family safety with gospel hospitality.  

## Next Meeting / Future Arrangements  
* Next week: continuation in James 2 (faith & works). Leader anticipates “really, really heavy stuff.”
