## Introduction  
* Pastor opens by honoring students who led worship, remembering his own first preaching opportunity.  
* Announces “Christmas at the Movies” (Nov 29–30) designed for evangelism.  
* Sets tone: Today’s shorter message focuses on what will matter when believers are “hugging Jesus”—handing down the faith.

## Scripture References  
* Hebrews 12:1–2  
* Hebrews 11  
* Judges 2:7–10  
* Genesis 25:21, 25–26  
* Genesis 37

## Key Points / Exposition  

### 1. The Christian Life Is a Relay Race  
* Hebrews 12:1–2 links believers to the “great cloud of witnesses” (Heb 11).  
* Analogy progression:  
  * Sprint = initial zeal (energy fades).  
  * Marathon = long-term rhythms (helpful but incomplete).  
  * Relay = success hinges on the baton pass.  
* Olympic 4×100 illustration (Tokyo 2021): U.S. team lost despite fastest runners; failure occurred in the exchange zone.  
* Spiritual exchange zone: the unbroken transfer of the gospel from the apostles to today’s church.

### 2. A Charge to the Younger Generation (< 35)  
* Cultural narrative labels Gen Z/Millennials as lazy, purposeless; Scripture and history disagree.  
* Ordinary vs. Extraordinary operations of the Spirit: periods when God does more in minutes than humans in decades (revival).  
* Survey of U.S. Great Awakenings:  
  1. First (1730s–40s) – Jonathan Edwards, George Whitefield.  
  2. Second (1790–1850) – Charles Finney, Father Nash.  
  3. Third (1900–10) – D. L. Moody, Azusa Street.  
  4. Fourth (late 1960s–70s) – Billy Graham, Chuck Smith, Jesus Movement.  
* Pattern: roughly 50-year intervals; timeline points to potential new move (≈ 2025).  
* Current indicators: Bible sales +42 %, Christian app downloads +80 %, worship streams +50 %, Gen Z/Millennials now largest church-attending block.  
* Historical fact: every awakening was sparked by leaders in their teens, 20s, or early 30s.  
* Call: Consecrate these years; trade drinking, gaming, and scrolling for gospel mission; ask, “What would I attempt if I knew God was in it?”

### 3. A Charge to the Older Generation (35+)  
* Judges 2:7–10—tragic failure when one generation doesn’t pass on what it has “seen.”  
* Gospel is always one generation from extinction; complacency is dangerous even in seasons of growth.  
* Biblical model of multigenerational transfer: Abraham → Isaac → Jacob.  
  * Abraham: first believer in family, a “blessed mess,” but changed the family tree.  
  * Isaac: did “a little better”—one wife, prayed, trusted God.  
  * Jacob: walked intimately with God; father of the 12 tribes.  
  * Principle: each generation’s ceiling becomes the next generation’s floor.  
* Societal commentary: culture dismantles fatherhood and expects government to fill the gap; church must raise strong spiritual mothers and fathers.  
* Pastor’s testimony:  
  * Grandfather Jerry—saved late, first college graduate at 50, small-church pastor.  
  * Father Rick—encourager, seminary-trained, church planter.  
  * Josh—beneficiary of 80 years of accumulated ministry experience at 35, now leading Lake Pointe.  
  * Illustration of baton successfully passed.

## Major Lessons & Revelations  
* God sovereignly places believers in a particular time with specific gifts to advance His kingdom.  
* Faith transmission is the central task of the church; revival often ignites through consecrated young adults supported by faithful elders.  
* Spiritual legacy requires intentionality; without it, an entire generation can “arise who do not know the Lord.”  
* When the baton is rightly passed, God multiplies impact—each generation stands on the shoulders of the previous one.

## Practical Application  
For the Under-35s:  
* Set holy rhythms: Scripture intake, confession, community, weekly worship.  
* Dream Kingdom dreams—career, finances, and relationships aimed at gospel expansion.  
* Pursue mentorship; step into leadership opportunities now.  

For the 35-Plus:  
* Pray daily for specific students, children, and young adults by name.  
* Model faithfulness: marriage, integrity, service, generosity.  
* Actively mentor—open homes, share testimonies, teach skills, finance mission trips, fund next-gen ministries.  
* Guard against complacency; celebrate growth yet press forward for future souls.

## Conclusion & Call to Response  
* The church stands in the “exchange zone” of history.  
* Older believers: “Run through the line” and extend the baton with clarity and encouragement.  
* Younger believers: Grip the baton with faith and sprint into God’s purposes, believing another awakening is imminent.  
* Congregation invited to commit—each group to its charge—for the glory of Christ and the salvation of those yet to come.
