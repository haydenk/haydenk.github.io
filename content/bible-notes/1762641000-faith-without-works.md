## Introduction  
*  The study opened with light conversation on New-Year resolutions, “trying” vs. “doing,” and how mere intention quickly fades.  
*  Tonight’s focus: James 2 : 14 - 26, presented as the “apex” of James—everything before it points forward and everything after it looks back.  
*  Goal: allow the passage to “penetrate marrow,” producing conviction and action rather than mere agreement.

## Scripture References

* Luke 10:25-37
* James 2:14-26
* Matthew 7:21-23
* Romans 3:28  

### Full Texts (NIV)  
Luke 10 : 25 - 37  
“On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus…‘Go and do likewise.’”

James 2 : 14 - 26  
“What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds?…as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.”

Matthew 7 : 21 - 23  
“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven…‘I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!’”

Romans 3 : 28  
“For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.”

## Key Points  
1.  Trying vs. Doing - Intention alone is cheap; commitment is proven only by action.  
2.  Good Samaritan (Luke 10) used as a primer: Jesus ends with, “Go and do likewise,” highlighting active mercy.  
3.  James asks two rhetorical questions (2 : 14) to expose counterfeit faith—faith that is only claimed, not lived.  
4.  “Faith without works is dead” appears three times (vv. 17, 20, 26) for emphasis.  
5.  Practical test (2 : 15-16): empty words toward a hungry brother or sister are worthless.  
6.  Even demons possess orthodox belief (2 : 19); true faith must go beyond mere assent.  
7.  Abraham (Gen 22) and Rahab (Josh 2) serve as polar-opposite models—both justified because belief issued in costly obedience.  
8.  Paul vs. James: not contradictory. Paul addresses the root (justification before God), James the fruit (vindication before people).  
9.  Dead faith is dangerous because it can masquerade as living, leaving a person self-deceived until judgment (Matt 7 : 21-23).

## Theological / Exegetical Points  
*  “Claims” (2 : 14) signals a profession lacking substance.  
*  Greek for “dead” (νεκρός) denotes lifeless, powerless, incapable of response.  
*  “Justified” (2 : 21) = shown righteous; context determines horizontal evidence, not initial salvation event.  
*  Abraham’s faith was “made complete” (ἐτελειώθη) through his action—faith reaches its intended goal in obedience.  
*  Rahab illustrates inclusivity: gender, ethnicity, and past sin do not bar genuine faith-expressed-in-works.  

## Interaction & Group Responses  
*  Why did priest & Levite pass by? Class offered: fear, inconvenience, ceremonial purity, no audience, superiority.  
*  Modern spiritualized excuses: “I’ll pray for you,” “Someone else will help,” “They brought it on themselves,” “Helping would enable sin.”  
*  Extended discussion on helping vs. enabling family members with addictions. Consensus:  
   *  There is a line where continued aid harms; discernment and conviction mark that boundary.  
   *  Refusing harmful aid can itself be a work of faith.  
*  Self-examination questions posed:  
   *  When did you last cross the road for someone you’d normally avoid?  
   *  What would Jesus say about your calendar and bank statement?  
   *  If faith were on trial, is there evidence enough to convict?  
*  Group acknowledged corporate guilt in giving words instead of practical help and resolved to seek Spirit-led opportunities for action.

## Practical Applications  
*  Replace “I’ll try” with concrete, measurable obedience.  
*  Carry emergency cash, water, or tools in the car to act when need appears.  
*  Schedule one deliberate act this week that costs comfort, time, or reputation.  
*  Review monthly budget: earmark a line for benevolence, missions, or local mercy.  
*  Use social-media “faith posts” sparingly; let in-person mercy be primary witness.  
*  Pray for Spirit-given discernment to know when help becomes enabling.  

## Prayer / Intercession Items  
*  Conviction leading to repentance where talk outweighs walk.  
*  Discernment for members facing complicated family-help situations.  
*  Courage to “cross the road” and engage the marginalized this week.
