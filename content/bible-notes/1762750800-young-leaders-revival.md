## Main Topics  
* Hebrews 12:1-2 – running our race, Jesus’ present ministry, and “passing the baton” to the young  
* The Great Awakening’s role in America’s birth; historic revivals led by 20-somethings  
* A fresh “rapture theory”: Paul’s “harpazō” experience (2 Cor 12) as template for 1 Th 4  
* Who wrote Hebrews? – strongest cases for Apollos vs. Paul; why Priscilla is unlikely  
* Jesus now: bodily enthroned, advocating as our defense attorney (1 Jn 2:1-2)  
* Calling the under-30 crowd: kill distraction, capture a God-sized vision, find mentors  
* Charge to 30-plus: invest in younger believers; your greatest impact may be someone you raise  
* Screen-time stats: the average 18-year-old is on pace to spend 93 % of free time on a screen  
* 2023 elections: Muslim-communist mayor (NYC) & VA delegate who texted about killing opponents  
* Growing male/female voting gap; roots in Marxist “oppressed/oppressor” worldview  
* Islam in the West: three-phase immigration pattern; Times Sq. “we will not stop” clip  
* Biblical immigration principles: welcome with moral alignment; government vs. individual roles  
* Government-as-savior rhetoric (“no problem too large for government”) contrasted with Christ

## Key Information  
* “Harpazō” (caught up) appears 1 Th 4:17 & 2 Cor 12:2; possible link—Paul personally experienced what believers will at Christ’s return.  
* Hebrews calls Jesus “seated...at the right hand”; 1 Jn 2 clarifies He is our Advocate—defense, not plea-for-mercy.  
* Revival leaders’ ages: W​hitfield 25, Finney 29, Lonnie Frisbee 20, Greg Laurie 17, etc.  
* Voting data: Women 18-29 backed NY & VA progressives 76-84 %; if only women voted, 461 electoral votes would go Democrat; only men, 350 Republican.  
* NYC mayoral voters: residents <5 yrs backed Mamdani 83 %; U.S.-born New Yorkers only 31 %.  
* Commonest baby boy name in many EU capitals: “Muhammad.”  

## Detailed Summary  
1. **Sermon content not used Sunday:** Josh theorizes Paul’s 2 Cor 12 “caught up” uses the same verb as 1 Th 4; perhaps God let Paul preview the rapture.  
2. **Hebrews 12 exposition:** Ancient runners stripped every weight—Christians drop sin; Jesus now bodily advocates for us.  
3. **Authorship debate:** Vocabulary & rhetoric suggest Apollos; masculine pronoun in Heb 11:32 rules out Priscilla.  
4. **Young-adult emphasis:** Scripture and U.S. revivals show God repeatedly uses teens-20s. Satan’s twin tactics: delay & distract.  
5. **Practical counsel:** Under 30—daily Bible/prayer, church, marry young, work hard, have “one more kid than you think.” Over 30—disciple younger believers; the greatest legacy may be who you develop.  
6. **Culture watch:** Modern Marxist lens breeds political violence (“ends justify means” texts from VA candidate).  
   * Women trending Left; men trending Right—possibly “government as protector/provider” vs. “rule-of-law” emphasis.  
7. **Islam & immigration:** Times Sq. rally vows global Islam; three-phase pattern (victim, indignant, dominant). Christians must pair gospel mission with wise policy; Scripture distinguishes personal compassion from the state’s protective role.  
8. **Government messianism:** New NYC mayor promises “no problem too large for government”—a direct replacement of God’s sufficiency.

## Action Items / Insights  
* Kill digital distractions; reclaim “free-time dots.”  
* Younger believers: pursue older mentors; older believers: initiate the relationship.  
* Parents: anchor children in a big God-given calling—behavior will follow vision.  
* Churches: prepare to counter both Marxist violence and Islamist triumphalism with gospel clarity.  
* Christians in public office: remember state authority serves limited, God-given purposes—protect, punish evil, preserve freedom.

## Conclusion  
From Hebrews 12’s call to run unencumbered to the cultural upheavals of 2023, the podcast presses believers to fix eyes on Jesus, steward their season (young or old), and engage society with both truth and love—confident that no government can rival the Savior who advocates for us even now.
