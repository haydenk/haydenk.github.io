## Introduction  
- Weekend celebration: ~3,000 participants graduating from the 10-week “Rooted” discipleship experience at Lake Point.  
- Upcoming evangelistic weekend: “Christmas at the Movies,” Nov 29–30, designed for guests far from God.  
- CS Lewis’s fictional dialogue in hell: the most effective lie is “There is no hurry.”  
- Transition to Acts 24: the Apostle Paul on trial before Governor Felix and his wife Drusilla—powerful, elite, yet spiritually undecided.

## Key Points / Exposition  

### 1. Righteousness: Achieved or Received?  
- Every world religion & secular philosophy views righteousness as something to earn; Christianity alone sees it as a gift to receive.  
    - Islam: Five Pillars; Buddhism: Eightfold Path; Mormonism: obedience for salvation; secular humanism: activism & virtue signaling.  
- Romans says “There is no one righteous, not even one.”  
- Ten-Commandment “pop quiz” demonstrates universal guilt (adultery, murder in the heart, theft, lying).  
- Two possible paths:  
    1. Achieve flawless obedience—impossible.  
    2. Receive Christ’s righteousness by faith (2 Cor 5:21).  

### 2. Self-Control: The Gatekeeper Virtue  
- Paul speaks to Felix & Drusilla’s sexual sin (adulterous relationship).  
- Principle: most destructive sins flow from lack of self-control (gluttony, addiction, gossip, greed, wrath).  
- Proverbs 25:28—person without self-control is a city with broken walls.  
- Specific cultural application:  
    - Singles: any sex outside covenant marriage = porneia (1 Thess 4).  
    - Marrieds: commanded not to deprive one another (1 Cor 7), yet many neglect intimacy.  
- Bodies belong to Christ (Rom 12:1); believers must “learn to control” desires, not be ruled by them.

### 3. The Judgment to Come  
- Felix trembles yet postpones decision: “When it is convenient I will call for you.”  
- Biblical certainties:  
    1. Jesus Himself is Judge (John 5:22).  
    2. Everyone will face judgment (Heb 9:27; Rom 14:10).  
    3. Two distinct judgments:  
        - Great White Throne—condemnation for unbelievers.  
        - Bema Seat—commendation & rewards for believers (Matt 16:27).  
    4. Christ’s return is certain and could interrupt ordinary life (Matt 24:37-39).  
- Historical prophecies already fulfilled (nation of Israel, Messiah’s virgin birth, 1948 statehood) assure future ones will also occur—Jesus will return.

## Major Lessons & Revelations  
- Delayed obedience is disobedience; spiritual procrastination destroys souls.  
- Righteousness cannot be earned; it is imputed through faith in Christ.  
- Self-control guards every other area of holiness.  
- The final judgment is not mythological—it is certain, personal, and imminent.

## Practical Application  
1. Receive Christ’s righteousness today—repent and believe the gospel.  
2. Conduct a self-control audit: identify desires (sexual, financial, verbal, appetites) where walls are down; submit them to the Spirit.  
3. Married couples: honor God by honoring marital intimacy; singles: honor God by abstaining until marriage.  
4. Live with eternity in view—invest time, resources, and testimony so you will be rewarded, not merely rescued.  
5. Invite unreached friends/family to Nov 29–30 outreach; prioritize their salvation.

## Conclusion & Call to Response  
- Like Felix, many “believe in heaven and hell” yet assume there is “no hurry.”  
- Pastor’s personal story: friend Ian postponed decision, died suddenly, and is now eternally lost.  
- Urgent appeal: forgive, confess, reconcile, share the gospel, join serious discipleship—do it now, not later.  
- Video testimony of a recent Rooted graduate shown to illustrate life-changing power of immediate obedience.
