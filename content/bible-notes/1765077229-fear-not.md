* Begins Advent series built around the angels’ four-part proclamation: “Fear not, good news, great joy, all people.”  
* Today’s focus: “Fear Not.” Acknowledges modern culture’s anxiety epidemic and media-driven fear.

* 2 Timothy 1:7
* Romans 3:25
* Genesis 3:10
* Exodus 12
* Joshua 1:9
* Matthew 1:23
* John 1:29
* 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18
* Romans 8:1
* Romans 8:38-39
* Jeremiah 29:11  

## Key Points / Exposition  

### 1. God Is For Us—The Atoning Savior  
* “Unto you is born … a Savior” (Luke 2). Jesus’ Aramaic name Yeshua derives from the verb yasha, “to rescue.”  
* Romans 3:25: Christ presented as a sacrifice of atonement.  
  * Explains atonement (“at-one-ment”)—reconciling sinners to God.  
* Biblical panorama of the spotless lamb:  
  * Genesis 3 – God covers Adam & Eve with a slain animal.  
  * Abraham & Isaac – substitutionary sacrifice on the mountain.  
  * Exodus 12 – Passover blood on doorposts prefigures the cross.  
  * John 1:29 – “Behold, the Lamb of God.”  
  * Crucifixion at 3 p.m.—exact hour Passover lambs were slain; temple veil torn, ending separation.  
* Announcement to Bethlehem shepherds (summer) likely addressed men raising sacrificial lambs—God signaling obsolete sacrifices.  
* Result: “No condemnation” (Romans 8:1); fear loses its legal right.  

### 2. God Is With Us—The Incarnate Emmanuel  
* “You will find a baby …” (Luke 2) + Matthew 1:23: Emmanuel, “God with us.”  
* Incarnation (Latin carne = flesh): God con-carne—God in flesh.  
* 2 Timothy 1:7 contrasts Holy Spirit of peace with demonic spirit of fear.  
* Repeated biblical command (366 times): “Fear not … for I am with you.”  
* Personal illustrations:  
  * Dad walking with frightened child into the dark; presence, not denial, removes dread.  
  * Pastor’s life-review: wife’s cancer scare, infertility/adoption journey, leadership through COVID—evidence of divine companionship clearer in hindsight.  

### 3. God Is Over All—The Sovereign Lord  
* Angels call Jesus “Christ the Lord.” Lordship = absolute ownership of every square inch.  
* Caesar’s census moves Mary & Joseph 95 miles to fulfill Micah’s Bethlehem prophecy; massive empire-wide decree orchestrated for one blue-collar couple.  
* Corrie Ten Boom’s flea-infested barracks: what they begged God to remove became the shield that allowed underground worship and evangelism.  
* Key takeaway: To receive “peace that surpasses understanding,” we relinquish the right to understand and trust His providence.  

## Major Lessons & Revelations  
* Fear is a spirit that prophesies lies; the Holy Spirit counters with truth and peace.  
* Jesus’ birth, life, and death complete God’s centuries-long redemptive pattern—fear is disarmed at the cross.  
* Divine presence (Emmanuel) is the most frequent biblical antidote to fear.  
* God’s sovereignty repurposes even unwanted “fleas” into instruments of salvation.  

## Practical Application  
1. Monitor Inputs: Limit fear-inducing media; remember “If it’s free, you’re the product.”  
2. Replace Acronym: Shift from “False Events Appearing Real” to “Father Eternal Almighty Reigns.”  
3. Declare Scripture: Verbally claim promises (2 Tim 1:7; Rom 8:38-39; Josh 1:9).  
4. Celebrate Miracles: Record and revisit past deliverances; celebration perpetuates faith.  
5. Practice Gratitude: Obey 1 Thess 5:16-18—even for the “fleas.”  

## Conclusion & Call to Response  
Christmas proclaims: God is for you (atonement), with you (incarnation), and over all things (sovereignty). Release fear, embrace the Prince of Peace, and step into courageous discipleship. Invitation extended to trust Christ, the Lamb who ended separation.  

## Prayer  
“Father, thank You for sending Jesus, the Lamb of God. Drive out every spirit of fear. Let Your manifest presence settle over each heart. Remind us there is now no condemnation and nothing can separate us from Your love. We rest in Your almighty arms, in Jesus’ name. Amen.”
