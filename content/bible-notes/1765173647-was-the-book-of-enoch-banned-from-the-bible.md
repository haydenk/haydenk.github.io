## Introduction  
Christmas week recap (33 000+ in-person), viral “Home Alone is a Christian movie” thread, upcoming candle-light services, hat giveaway, and community/Rooted plug. Main study blocks:  
1. Luke 2 Advent deep-dive (shepherds, Lamb imagery, “Fear not”).  
2. How to fight fear with Scripture.  
3. What the Book of Enoch is—and why it is not Bible.  
4. Rapid response to a 15-million-view deconstruction video (“Bible compiled by Constantine” myth).  

## Key Points  
1. LUKE 2 & THE SCARLET THREAD
   * Angels announce to *shepherds*—lowest social class—signalling Christ came for the humble.
   * Bethlehem = "House of Bread"; Jesus the "Bread of Life" is born there.
   * Shepherds likely raised Temple lambs; Jesus laid in a stone manger—the cradle used for newborn lambs.
   * Mal 4:2 "healing in his wings (כָּנָף kanaph)" connects to the woman in Mark 5 who touched Jesus' robe-fringe.
   * OT preview → cross: slain animal in Eden, ram for Isaac, Passover blood-cross on doorposts, Day of Atonement veil, culminating in "Behold, the Lamb of God" (Jn 1:29).
   * Veil torn top-to-bottom (Mt 27:51) = separation removed; darkness + cry "My God, why have you forsaken Me?" = Father turns from Son so He can turn to us.  

2. "FEAR NOT" – PRACTICAL DISCIPLESHIP
   * First fear appears Gen 3.
   * Believer's single controlling fear = fear of God, which displaces fear of man.
   * Strategy: take every thought captive (2 Co 10:5). Ask each thought its "country of origin." If it breeds fear/accusation it comes from the kingdom of darkness.
   * Wallpaper your life with promises. Example verse list Ps. Josh used to exit anxiety season.
   * Watchman Nee triad: Facts → Faith → Feelings (never reverse).
   * Four contrasts (Driscoll): fear looks out / faith looks up; fear listens to world / faith to Word; fear stops living / faith starts living; fear unsettles / faith settles.  

3. BOOK OF ENOCH CLARIFIED
   * Written 3rd–1st c. BC, *pseudepigraphal* (falsely attributed to Enoch).
   * Never part of Hebrew Bible, Septuagint, or early NT canon lists; only Ethiopian Orthodox later adopted it.
   * Early church & rabbinic Judaism rejected it because:
      * Too late to be eyewitness/prophetic.
      * Contains teachings contradicting Scripture (e.g., timing of angelic fall).
   * NT citation (Jude 14-15) = true statement used illustratively; quotation ≠ canonisation (cf. Paul quoting pagan poets, Acts 17; Titus 1:12).
   * Caution: fascination with hidden things (Nephilim, "watchers") can eclipse knowing what God *has* revealed (Dt 29:29; 1 Ti 1:4-6).  

4. RAPID RESPONSE TO VIRAL "CONSTANTINE CHOSE THE BIBLE" CLIP
   * Jesus affirmed OT (Mt 5:17-18) and foretold NT inspiration (Jn 16:13).
   * Manuscript evidence: ≈ 6 000 Greek NT mss ≤ 100 yrs from events; 99.5 % textual purity—vastly stronger than Plato, Caesar, etc.
   * Council of Nicaea (AD 325) debated Christ's deity, **not** canon; earliest full NT list AD 367 (Athanasius) followed by Synod of Carthage 397—no emperor present.
   * "Two different Gods" (OT vs NT) is ancient heresy (Marcionism). Jesus *is* Yahweh (Jn 8:58). Judgment and mercy appear in both Testaments.
   * Accepting only parts we like leads to "spot-inspiration" and a god remade in our image.  

## Theological / Exegetical Points

* Typology: Passover lamb → Christ; kanaph fringe → healing prophecy; shepherd motif; magi possibly discipled legacy of Daniel.
* Inspiration: verbal-plenary; 2 Pe 3 already labels Paul's letters "Scripture."
* Canon criteria: apostolic authorship, early date, doctrinal harmony, corporate acceptance.
* Fear vs. faith: biblical anthropology of thought life; spiritual warfare in mind.  

## Interaction & Group Responses

* Light banter: "Home Alone" gospel parallels (Old Man Marley's pierced hand).
* Carlos & Josh enthusiastic; Paul "healthy skeptic" on hidden-knowledge trends.
* Audience engagement: comments on Christmas-tree timing, pajama poll, 20+ members sending the viral clip.  

## Practical Applications  
1. Memorise core promises; replace fearful imaginations with scriptural facts.  
2. Evaluate every teaching (podcast, reel, article) against whole-Bible testimony and reliable historical data.  
3. Use this guide with your Life-Group; discuss Luke 2 implications for humility and mission.  
4. If new to community, register for “Rooted” (text ROOTED to 20411).  

## Prayer / Intercession Items

* Thank God for Scripture and the revealed Lamb.
* Courage for listeners battling anxiety.
* Wisdom to discern truth from counterfeit teaching.
* Salvation & freedom for Christmas guests.  

## Next Meeting / Future Arrangements

* Candle-light services (30+ options; text CHRISTMAS to 20411).
* Next podcast topic teased: "Should Christians teach their kids about Santa Claus?"
