# State-of-the-Pod Celebration  

## Opening Moments  
Laughter, snorts, and a playful “Let’s kick this pig” opened episode 56—a surprise year-end bonus recorded minutes after Pastor Josh stepped off the Christmas-service stage at Lake Pointe. The mood: breathless joy and holy awe at what God has done in just one year.

## Testimonies  

### Pastor Josh

* Fresh from preaching, he stared at "thousands of people walking through the halls" and kept repeating the numbers with disbelief—"7.5 million… 867 million views… that is stupid!"
* Philosophy: the podcast is "air-war discipleship." Sunday sermons handle the ground war; the pod tackles cultural issues so "the enemy can't take back the ground."
* Scripture referenced: Acts 17 (the Areopagus) and 2 Corinthians 10:5 ("we destroy arguments and take every thought captive").
* Heart cry: "We are not in the view-count business; we are in the discipleship business."
* Dreaming forward: hopes Live Free will become "the staging grounds for the resurgence of the church in our nation."

### Carlos Erazo

* Sprinted from the service to the mic in one minute—team-timed.
* Rolled out the stats:
  * 7.5 million plays, 3.5 million on YouTube alone
  * 481 K new YouTube subscribers (-375 % jump)
  * 1.4 M new Facebook followers, 600 K on IG, 258 K on TikTok
  * 867 million total short-form views
  * 4 million audio streams; top-4 in Apple's Religion & Spirituality
  * 182 countries reached; 400 % rise in Church-Online attendance
* Story: Molly from Chicago found the pod, "reignited my faith," flew to Lake Pointe, and was baptized.
* Passion: helping "many men find their band of brothers" through life groups.  

## Holy-Spirit Highlights

* Jaw-dropping reach—proof that every metric is "a real person with a real hunger for a real God."
* Organic, unprompted discipleship groups springing up in coffee shops at 7 a.m.
* Clear sense that social media is today's Areopagus where the gospel must sound.
* Repeated gratitude: "Praise the Lord… this is insane… completely stunned."  

## Prayer Points & Next Steps

* Ask the Lord to turn every view into true life-change and brotherhood.
* Gather listener feedback on YouTube: "Why is it working? What should we double down on?"
* Encourage listeners to text APP to 20411 for the redesigned Lake Pointe app—sermon, podcast, one-chapter-a-day plan, and discipleship guide all in one place.
* Invitation: email podcast@lakepointe.church or text CONNECT to 20411 to serve, share stories, or help the movement grow.  

## Closing Blessing  
Pastor Josh, hurrying to preach his seventh Christmas service, clasped hands with Carlos and said, “Live free, brother.”
