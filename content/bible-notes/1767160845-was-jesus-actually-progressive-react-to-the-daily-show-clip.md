# Progressivism vs. Historic Christianity

* Discerning true progress from cultural decay.

## Scripture References

* Matthew 25
* Matthew 5–7
* Matthew 19:4–6
* Genesis 3
* Deuteronomy
* Nehemiah
* Romans 13
* 1 Thessalonians 3:10 (allusion)
* Galatians
* 2 Corinthians 11:14

## Introduction  
A viral Daily Show clip by author/comedian John Fugelsang claims Jesus was “inherently progressive.” Because similar arguments intensify around election seasons, the speaker equips believers to test such claims against Scripture—following the Berean model of examining everything and holding fast to what is good.

## Key Points / Exposition  

### 1. Not All Change Is Progress

* Progressivism's very name presumes moving "past" existing standards; biblically, some so-called progress is moral decay.
* Christians must measure change by Scripture, not cultural momentum.

### 2. Scripture Can Be Weaponised

* Bad actors often quote the Bible—Satan in Eden, Pharisees, "super-apostles" (2 Cor 11), Judaizers (Galatians).
* Therefore, Christians must "test everything" (Acts 17 Bereans) rather than accept claims at face value.

### 3. Kuyperian Sphere Sovereignty: Distinct Roles

* God instituted three spheres:
  * Family – procreation, child-rearing, education, discipleship
  * Church – Word, sacrament, benevolence
  * State – law, order, justice, common defense
* Social chaos arises when one sphere invades another's lane. Fugelsang conflates individual/ church commands (e.g., charity to poor, welcoming strangers) with governmental mandates.

### 4. Matthew 25 Misread: Sheep, Goats, & Governments

* Jesus gathers "the nations" but judges individuals. The passage nowhere instructs civil government to redistribute wealth or manage social programs.
* Individual Christians and churches bear primary responsibility for mercy ministries.

### 5. "Left-Coded Christian Nationalism"

* Progressives appeal to the Bible for immigration, welfare, etc., yet decry "Christian nationalism" when conservatives cite Scripture for life, marriage, or morality.
* Using biblical imperatives selectively for policy is still an attempt at theocratic imposition—just in another direction.

### 6. Mislabeling Disagreement as Hate

* Claim: Jesus said nothing about abortion, gender ideology, or "trans kids."
* Rebuttal:
  * Murder condemned (Mt 5–7).
  * Sex and gender affirmed as male/female; marriage defined as one man–one woman (Mt 19).
  * Disagreement ≠ hatred; truth spoken in love is not violence.

### 7. Historical Revisionism & the Crusades

* Progressivism often retells history with Christians as villains to discredit biblical morality.
* Broadly, the Crusades were defensive responses to centuries of Islamic conquest—fitting just-war criteria, though abuses occurred.

### 8. Government, Violence, and the Sword (Rom 13)

* Scripture authorises the state to be "a terror to evildoers," even wielding the sword (capital punishment).
* Progressivism's optimism about human nature ("people are basically good") collides with the doctrine of total depravity; unchecked evil must be restrained.
* Jesus endorsed lawful self-defense (Lk 22:36) and never condemned military service (cf. John Baptist's counsel to soldiers, Lk 3:14).

### 9. Jesus Is Lord, Not a Mascot

* Selectively editing Jesus (e.g., "brown-skinned man executed by the state") molds Him into a progressive icon while omitting teachings that confront modern sexual ethics, personal repentance, and judgment.
* True disciples submit to the whole Christ, not a curated caricature.

## Major Lessons & Revelations

* Scripture must interpret culture, not vice versa.
* Distinguishing the duties of family, church, and state preserves social flourishing.
* Selective Bible use—left or right—becomes deception.
* A biblical anthropology (human sinfulness) undergirds the need for law, order, and the gospel.
* Jesus cannot be conscripted into partisan agendas; His lordship challenges every ideology.

## Practical Application

* Practice Berean discernment: verify every public claim—especially political—by open Bible study.
* Engage in personal generosity: tithe, give, volunteer, adopt; don't outsource compassion to taxation alone.
* Support governmental functions that align with Romans 13 (justice, safety) while urging the church to expand mercy ministries.
* Speak truth in love on contentious issues—refusing both hateful rhetoric and silent compromise.
* Learn accurate church history to counter revisionist narratives.

## Conclusion & Call to Response  
Christians face mounting pressure to baptize every “progressive” trend. The call is to resist selective scripture, test every spirit, and follow the whole counsel of God. Stand firm: affirm Kingdom compassion at the personal level, uphold biblical morality in public life, and confess Jesus as Lord over all spheres.
