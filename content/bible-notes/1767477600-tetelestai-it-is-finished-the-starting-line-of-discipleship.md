## Key Points / Exposition  

### 1. "It Is Finished" — What Was Finished

* Jesus' final word (Greek: Tetelestai) on the cross (John 19:30) is the most important word in Scripture.
* Everyday Greek usages illuminate its meaning:
  * Business: written on receipts—"debt paid in full."
  * Judicial: inscribed on a criminal's record—"sentence fully served."
  * Military: battle cry of victory—"enemy defeated."
* At Calvary:
  * PAYMENT: Christ settled humanity's sin-debt completely (1 Jn 4:10; propitiation).
  * PENALTY: Divine justice fully satisfied—no double jeopardy for sin.
  * POWER: Serpent-crusher of Genesis 3:15 wins the cosmic war; victory imputed to those who didn't fight.  

### 2. "It **Is** Finished" — The Ongoing Reality

* Discipleship begins with trusting, not trying; otherwise the gospel degrades into self-help.
* Perfect-tense verb: a past, completed act with abiding results. Nothing can alter the "state of affairs."
* Common distortions:
  1. "It **was** finished" — God loved me then, but I blew it.
  2. "It's **kind of** finished" — grace starts salvation; works keep it (official Catholic position refuted by Gal 2:16).
  3. "It **will be** finished" — God will love a future, improved version of me.
* Biblical truth: right now, it **is** finished. Ephesians 2:8-9 anchors salvation by grace through faith alone.
* Courtroom imagery (1 Jn 1–2):
  * Satan = prosecuting attorney (Rev 12:10), citing sin and demanding death (Rom 6:23).
  * Jesus = defense attorney/advocate (1 Jn 2:1-2), presenting nail-scarred hands as proof that punishment already fell; to condemn again would be unjust.
* Walking in the light (1 Jn 1:5-10): not perfection but nothing hidden—confession, honesty, and fellowship.  

### 3. Identity Formed by Finished Work

* Only Jesus defines you; you are not your sin, success, orientation, addiction, divorce, abortion, or Instagram likes.
* Extensive biblical identity declarations were read aloud (e.g., light of the world, temple of the Spirit, chosen race, saint, etc.), reinforcing that believers live under a banner reading "Paid in Full."  

## Major Lessons & Revelations

* True discipleship grows from the bedrock of Christ's completed work; we obey from acceptance, not for acceptance.
* God's justice now **requires** Him to forgive believers because their sin has already been punished in Christ.
* The enemy cannot steal salvation, so he tries to rob believers of enjoying it through accusations and shame.
* Mission clarity: Lake Pointe exists to make disciples who embrace the cross, pursue one more soul, and live on the Word of God.  

## Practical Application

* Carry the "Field Guide" and a physical Bible each week; rustle pages together.
* Tear off "One More" card: write the person closest to you yet farthest from God; place it privately (mirror, dashboard) and pray daily for gospel opportunities.
* Sync to the church calendar—prioritize family rhythms around corporate prayer (Jan 21 Night of Prayer & Worship) and discipleship environments (Rooted, groups).
* Download the new Lake Pointe app: follow daily one-chapter Bible plan, watch sermons, listen to Lift Read for deeper study.
* Continually ask, "What is my next step of obedience?" and act on it rather than trying to tackle everything at once.
* When you sin, run **to** the Father, not away; confess, receive forgiveness, walk in the light.  

## Conclusion & Call to Response  
• Discipleship starts at the cross: Tetelestai. Receive, then follow.  
• Pastor invited anyone lacking assurance to whisper a prayer of surrender—“God, I’m Yours; the cross counts for me”—marking a new lineage and legacy.  
• Church prayed for fresh awareness of grace and courage to abide in Christ throughout 2026.  

## Prayer

* Thanksgiving for the finished work of Christ and its present power.
* Petition that every hearer would believe, maybe for the first time, that "it is finished" for them.
* Request for daily abiding—spiritual power on families, lives, and generations.
