## Scripture References

* Luke 1:1–4
* Luke 2:21
* John 19:30
* James 1:5 (alluded to in the "ask for wisdom" discussion)

## Introduction

The group mirrored Sunday's sermon on John 19:30 ("It is finished"), asking: "If Jesus really finished the work, is my life showing that I believe it?" Big idea: "If Jesus truly finished the work, trusting Him isn't optional; it is simply what belief looks like."

## Key Points

* Western culture prizes self-reliance; trust in others (and in God) is declining.
* Many believers agree we do not earn salvation by works, yet live as though we must maintain it by works.
* Three common postures in the body:
  1. Reluctant receivers – cannot ask for help.
  2. Willing givers – need to notice and offer help.
  3. Over-reliant – need to "pick up your mat and walk."
* Striving itself is not wrong; motive and outcome determine whether it honors God.
* Practical tests for motives:
  * Does it draw me or others nearer to Christ?
  * Can I surrender it if God removes it?
  * Have I brought it into the light with Scripture, prayer, and trusted counsel?

## Theological / Exegetical Points

* Luke 1:1–4 – Luke grounds the gospel in careful investigation, eyewitness testimony, and "certainty," countering doubt and equipping believers to speak confidently.
* Luke 2:21 – Jesus' name ("The Lord saves") shows salvation is 100% God-initiated, defined before Jesus performed any act.
* John 19:30 – "Tetelestai" (It is finished) carried three everyday meanings:
  1. Business – debt paid in full.
  2. Judicial – sentence served completely.
  3. Military – battle decisively won.
  Together they proclaim that nothing remains for us to add.

## Interaction & Group Responses

* "Things I hate asking help with": money, work tasks, moving, reading glasses, furniture, personal prayer, finances ("anything and everything").
* Several men admitted pride, fear of burdening others, past disappointments, and desire for control keep them from asking help.
* Statistics cited: trust in U.S. adults dropped from 46% (1970s) to 34% (2020).
* Personal testimonies:
  * Leader's family once lived on one teacher salary; in-laws housed them; a friend unexpectedly gave $1000 – vivid picture of God's provision.
  * Online-dating story: when surrendered to God, He provided a wife quickly.
* Discernment tools named: Scripture, prayer, Holy Spirit conviction, honest self-examination, input from close brothers ("press-box" view vs. "in-your-face" accountability).
* Question repeatedly posed: "Where does my life show I'm still acting as though something is unfinished?"

## Practical Applications

1. Replace "If it's to be, it's up to me" with conscious dependence on Jesus' finished work.
2. Cultivate transparency: regularly invite a trusted circle to ask hard questions.
3. Ask God for wisdom (James 1:5) and expect Him to give clarity.
4. Hold resources loosely; be ready to give or lose them without losing peace.
5. When facing decisions:
   a. Pray and search Scripture.
   b. Check motives (kingdom or self).
   c. Seek counsel from spiritually mature believers.
   d. Submit final outcome to God's sovereignty.
6. Practice both giving and receiving help as normal Christian life, not exceptional charity.

## Prayer / Intercession Items

* Several men struggling financially – pray for provision and deeper trust.
* Growth in vulnerability: courage to ask for prayer for personal needs.
* Wisdom for upcoming career or life decisions; willingness to let God close or open doors.
* Freedom from the habit of striving for approval; rest in Christ's completed work.
