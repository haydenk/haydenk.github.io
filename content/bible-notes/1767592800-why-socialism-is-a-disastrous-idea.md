## Introduction

* Week 1 of Lake Pointe's year-long "Boot-Camp Training for Team Jesus."
* Ps. Josh's Sunday message centred on Jesus' cry Τετέλεσται ("It is finished") and launched a discussion of atonement, personal discipleship rhythms, and cultural issues (race, adoption, socialism).  

## Key Points

1. Τετέλεσται – "Paid in full / completed / won."
   * Financial: debt cancelled.
   * Judicial: sentence served.
   * Military: victory cry.
2. Prophetic checklist: Jesus consciously fulfilled every OT promise (John 19:28).
3. "I thirst" & the Smitten Rock:
   * Moses struck the rock (Num 20); waters flowed.
   * On the cross the "Rock" is struck; living water flows, hence His thirst.
4. Hyssop theme (Ex 12; Lev 14; Ps 51): cleansing, Passover blood, leper purification—all converge in John 19:29.
5. Creation & New-Creation link: Gen 2:1-3 "finished" → Sabbath; John 19 "finished" → Sabbath begins; Jesus ushers new creation.
6. Six major atonement "facets":
   * Moral Influence: Christ changes us.
   * Christus Victor: Christ conquers powers.
   * Ransom/Redemption: Christ purchases us.
   * Satisfaction: Christ upholds God's honour.
   * Recapitulation: Christ succeeds where Adam failed.
   * Penal Substitution (central): Christ bears our penalty.
7. Penal Substitution attacked = first domino in many modern apostasies; importance of Trinitarian clarity and biblical authority.
8. Gospel = freedom from, not freedom to, sin. Love for Christ fuels obedience.  

## Theological / Exegetical Points

* Same Greek root for "knowing all was now finished" and "It is finished."
* Tersorium detail: likely a soldier's latrine sponge pressed to Jesus' lips, highlighting the depth of His humiliation.
* Septuagint echo: Gen 2:1 "finished" (sunetelesthē) → Sabbath rest; John 19:30 tetelestai → ultimate rest.
* Col 2:13-15 ties Christus Victor directly to penal substitution (record of debt nailed to cross).
* Early church and Spurgeon: pastors must confront false gospels (e.g., Spurgeon's public refutation of Marxist "democratic socialism").  

## Interaction & Group Responses

* Light-hearted banter: New-Year resolutions, BC/AD quiz, tattoos (Paul's Greek arm ink), Elon Musk retweeting Josh's reparations tweet (2.3 M views).
* Candid race dialogue: Josh's transracial adoption story; determination to reject victim mentality.
* Giveaway prompt: "Do New-Year resolutions work? – comment on YouTube."
* Listener testimony: Brian (Indiana) flew in after podcast sparked Bible engagement.  

## Practical Applications

1. Preach the gospel to yourself daily to resist drift toward "faith + works."
2. Foster rhythms: daily Bible reading (new Lake Pointe app), Sunday sermon, Live Free podcast, discipleship groups.
3. Engage cultural narratives:
   * Reject collectivist visions that trade God-given individual dignity for state power.
   * Use biblical wisdom (consider incentives & trade-offs) when evaluating policies (e.g., reparations, socialism).
4. Parents: speak frankly about race; fight victim-mindsets with gospel identity.
5. Personal holiness flows from love received: "If you love Me, you will obey."  

## Prayer / Intercession Items

* Deeper revelation of Christ's finished work in every member.
* Protection against false gospels infiltrating pulpits.
* Night of Prayer & Worship (21 Jan, 7 – 8:30 pm CST): healings, breakthrough, "one more" salvation.
* Brian and other young men newly opening the Word.
* Unity and wisdom amid cultural tensions (race, politics, economics).  

## Next Meeting / Future Arrangements

* Comment on YouTube to enter hat giveaway; topic: effectiveness of resolutions.
* Download Lake Pointe app (text "APP" to 20411) to follow the 2026 discipleship journey.
* Night of Prayer & Worship: 21 Jan (on-site & online).
