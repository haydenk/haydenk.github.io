## Introduction

* Series: "Boot Camp – Training for Team Jesus."
* Year-long theme: "I am a disciple." Congregation using a "Field Guide" to pray over one specific next-step in discipleship.
* Today's focus: a disciple is "baptized in water and Spirit."
* Humorous opening: video of young Caroline taking medicine, mimicking pastor's salvation invitation count-down—illustrates responding in obedience.
* Setting: Luke 3 and the ministry of John the Baptizer—eccentric, fearless forerunner who prepared Israel for Messiah after 400 years of prophetic silence.

## Key Points / Exposition  

### 1. A Disciple Must Be Baptized in Water

* Baptism = commanded, not suggested; public declaration of new association with Christ.
* Greek baptizō: dip, dunk, submerge. Everyday word (even used in 1st-century pickle recipes) ⇒ full immersion, not sprinkling.
* Symbolism: Romans 6 – "dead, buried, raised." Down into the water = united with Christ's death; raised = newness of life.
* Baptism does not save; it visibly testifies to an already-existing, personal faith (wedding-ring analogy).
* Infant baptism: noble parental intent, but New Testament pattern is believer's baptism—an expression of the individual's own faith.
* Jesus' example (Matthew 3): though sinless, He was baptized "to fulfill all righteousness." If He submitted, His disciples must.
* Obedience issue, not preference: hiding faith is as unthinkable as refusing a wedding ring after proposing.

### 2. A Disciple Needs to Be Filled with the Holy Spirit

* At Jesus' baptism: heavens open, Spirit descends and "remains," Father affirms Son—model for Spirit-filled life.
* Effects of Spirit-filling:
  * Power for holiness.
  * Experiential assurance of the Father's love.
  * Power for supernatural ministry.
* Jesus ministered "full of," "led by," "in the power of," and "rejoicing in" the Spirit (Luke 4; Luke 10:21) — if He needed the Spirit, we certainly do.
* Three distinct but interconnected works seen in Scripture:
  1. Salvation – Spirit baptizes us into Christ (1 Cor 12:13).
  2. Water Baptism – a disciple baptizes us in obedience (Matt 28:19).
  3. Spirit Filling – Jesus baptizes/fills us with the Holy Spirit (Luke 3:16; Acts 1:4-5).
* Continuous need: Ephesians 5:18 commands already-saved believers to "be filled" (present tense, ongoing).
* Biblical pattern illustrated:
  * Acts 2:38 – repent (salvation), be baptized, receive the Spirit.
  * Acts 8:12-17 – believed, baptized, then apostles lay hands to receive the Spirit.
  * Acts 19:1-6 – disciples who had believed are re-baptized in Jesus' name and then receive the Spirit through Paul's hands.
* Pickle illustration: baptizō implies prolonged immersion producing total change—believers need to be "pickled" in the Spirit, not merely dipped.

## Major Lessons & Revelations

* Public, obedient identification with Christ (water) and experiential empowerment by Christ (Spirit) are both normative for disciples.
* Salvation is personal; God saves first names, not last names.
* Spiritual power is not optional: the people of God need the Spirit of God to live for the glory of God.
* The courage to go public for Jesus must surpass the world's boldness in flaunting sin.

## Practical Application

1. Haven't been baptized post-conversion? Text "LIFE" to 20411 today and schedule baptism.
2. Prepare hearts for January 21 Prayer & Worship Night—ask daily: "Holy Spirit, if I'm missing anything, I want all You have."
3. Use the Field Guide: pray for the single next step Jesus is asking in your discipleship journey.
4. Reject fear of man; proclaim faith openly at work, school, online.
5. Continually ask for fresh filling—repent of known sin, worship, receive prayer, and step out in ministry.

## Conclusion & Call to Response  
The world fearlessly parades wickedness; therefore disciples must courageously declare allegiance through water baptism and Spirit-empowered living. If you need baptism, act today. If you are dry, seek the Spirit’s fullness—salvation, baptism, and Spirit filling are the normal Christian life.

## Prayer  
“Father, make us a people who say, ‘Holy Spirit, You are welcome here.’ We confess our need for supernatural power to face supernatural problems. Give every believer the courage to obey in baptism and the hunger to be filled from head to toe with Your Spirit, for Jesus’ glory. Amen.”
