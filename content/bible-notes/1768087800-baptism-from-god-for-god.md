## Scripture References

* Matthew 28:19–20
* Luke 3:21–22
* Romans 6:3–4
* Ephesians 1:13

## Introduction

The group launched week 2 of an eight-week discipleship series that parallels Sunday sermons at Lake Pointe. Tonight's focus: baptism—Is it something we do for God, or something God does for us?  

## Key Points

* Two emphases of baptism
  * **From God**: unmerited grace; gift of the Holy Spirit; empowerment that precedes performance.
  * **For God**: public confession, obedience, declaration of allegiance, identification with Christ's body.
* "Chain of events" often observed in Scripture
  1. Salvation
  2. Baptism
  3. Receiving/empowerment of the Holy Spirit
  (Illustrated with cybersecurity "kill-chain" analogy.)
* Potential drifts
  * "From God" only → receiving without responding = belief without obedience.
  * "For God" only → obedience without promise = fragile, legalistic faith.
* Identity before commissioning: at Jesus' baptism the Father declares, "You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased" (Luke 3:22) before any public ministry.  

## Theological / Exegetical Points

* New-Testament writers never separate salvation and baptism; Jesus' Great Commission lists "baptize" without isolating "get them saved."
* Romans 6:3–4 links immersion to burial and resurrection with Christ.
* Ephesians 1:13 highlights sealing by the Spirit upon belief; discussion noted differing traditions on whether this coincides with baptism.
* Thief on the cross shows salvation can precede or exclude baptism in extraordinary circumstances, yet normal pattern in Acts ties them together.
* Old-Testament anointing with oil (kings, priests, prophets) = God's presence promised; New-Testament baptism in water = God's presence realized.
* Luke alone records Jesus praying during baptism; prayer portrayed as the open channel through which the Spirit descends.  

## Interaction & Group Responses

* Quick poll: most see baptism as both "from" and "for" God.
* Lively debate on "salvation stands alone" vs. "baptism essential."
* Personal testimonies:
  * Tyler—re-baptized as an adult once he understood sin and grace.
  * Jim—recent baptism after grasping personal depravity.
* Parenting angle: when children ask to be baptized, begin with "Why?" and probe understanding of sin, salvation, and symbolism.
* Practical questions used when calling candidates (Lake Pointe's "Text LIFE" follow-up team): "Tell me about your conversion," "Why baptism now?"
* Humor: "Is a pickle a cucumber or is a cucumber a pickle?"—illustration of transformation.  

## Practical Applications

1. Examine your own baptism: Was it post-conversion and understood? If not, consider being baptized.
2. When discipling others, ensure they grasp depravity, grace, and the Spirit's role before scheduling baptism.
3. Remember identity precedes assignment—receive God's affirmation before rushing into service.
4. Approach baptism as a launchpad for Spirit-empowered obedience, not mere "fire-insurance."
5. Pray—though not a technical prerequisite, prayer is the primary vehicle for fresh filling and guidance by the Spirit.
