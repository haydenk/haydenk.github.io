## Introduction
The episode tackles four main topics:
1. Frequently shouted questions about baptism (infant vs. believer's, mode, purpose).
2. Catholic, paedo-Baptist, and credo-Baptist positions contrasted.
3. "Baptism in / filling with" the Holy Spirit—why believers still need fresh encounters after conversion.
4. A real-time cultural case study: the Minneapolis ICE shooting, discernment, and the biblical call to resist a "spirit of lawlessness."

## Key Points
1. Salvation is by grace alone through faith alone—“apart from works.”
2. In the New Testament baptism always follows personal repentance and faith; no explicit infant-baptism command or example exists.
3. Three historic views:
   * Roman Catholic / baptismal regeneration (sacramental, saves, usually by pouring).
   * Protestant paedo-Baptist (sign of covenant, anticipates future faith, usually sprinkling).
   * Protestant credo-Baptist (sign of accomplished salvation, for believers only, immersion).
4. Catholics cite John 3:5; Acts 2:38; 1 Peter 3:21. Protestants respond:
   * John 3:5 echoes Ezekiel 36 (spiritual cleansing, not literal baptism).
   * Acts 2:38 couples repentance and baptism because both normally occur together, not because baptism itself saves.
   * 1 Peter 3:21 speaks metaphorically—"an appeal to God for a good conscience," not the removal of dirt.
5. Scriptural and historical evidence of post-conversion Spirit-filling: the apostles (John 20; Acts 2; Acts 4), believers at Ephesus (Ephesians 5:18), plus testimonies (Moody, Edwards, Wesley, Pascal, Aquinas, Josh Howerton).
6. Christians are commanded to be continually filled with the Spirit for assurance, power, peace, and love.
7. Lawlessness vs. biblical justice: believers must reflect before reacting; verify facts (Proverbs 18:17) and honor God-ordained authority (Romans 13).
8. Minneapolis illustration: selective footage stirred outrage; fuller video showed the agent struck by the car—highlighting the need for discernment.

## Theological / Exegetical Points
* Metonymy: "baptism" can stand for the whole salvation event; water alone does not justify.
* Day of Atonement typology: two identical goats foreshadow Jesus (sacrifice) and Barabbas (scapegoat).
* Trinitarian revelation at Jesus' baptism—Father's voice reveals the heart of true fatherhood ("You are my beloved Son…") and affirms identity before performance.
* Spirit-filling language: "baptism," "filling," "unction" point to the same experiential grace.

## Interaction & Group Responses
* Hosts share personal stories: Josh Howerton's 2014 Spirit-encounter; childhood baptisms; humorous cultural mash-ups.
* Audience sent in a child quoting Josh's three-step invitation ("God loves you… lock that elbow!")—illustrates baptism enthusiasm.
* Live chat questions addressed: rebaptism after infant sprinkling, timing for children, baptism after recommitment ("one-and-done").

## Practical Applications
1. If you were sprinkled as an infant, consider believer's baptism to ratify your own faith and honor your parents' intent.
2. Parents: look for ongoing evidence of repentance and desire before baptizing young children.
3. Seek continual filling with the Holy Spirit—ask, seek, knock (Luke 11:13); attend prayer & worship gatherings expectant.
4. When cultural crises erupt:
   * Slow down; gather full information.
   * Reject predetermined "oppressor/oppressed" narratives; pursue truth and justice.
   * Pray for all involved (victims, officers, communities).
5. Model godly fatherhood: communicate "You are my beloved child; with you I am well pleased."
6. Submit to legitimate authorities unless commanded to sin; aim for reformation, not lawlessness.

### Views on Baptism

|  | Who It's For | How It's Done | What It Does |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| Roman Catholic | Infants and believers | Typically pouring | * Initiates the person into salvation. Removes original sin and confers regeneration and saving grace.<br> * Brings the person into the Catholic Church. |
| Protestant Paedobaptist | Infants and believers | Typically sprinkling or pouring, sometimes immersion | * Points expectantly to the salvation of the person that must still happen in the future.<br> * Brings the person into the visible, local church. |
| Protestant Credobaptist | Believers | Immersion | * Points to the person's salvation that has already happened in the past.<br> * Signifies the person being a part of the invisible, universal Church, and brings the person into the visible, local church. |

## Prayer / Intercession Items
* Comfort for the Minneapolis mother's family, the injured agent, and the city's peace.
* Outpouring of the Spirit at upcoming Prayer & Worship Night (Jan 21).
* Boldness for new believers to follow Christ in baptism.
* Healing, renewal, and protection over those hurt by past church abuse.
* Greater discernment for believers navigating media-driven outrage cycles.

## Next Meeting / Future Arrangements
* Live Free Prayer & Worship Night – January 21, 7–8:30 p.m. (all campuses + online).
* Text "EVENT" to 20411 or visit lakepointe.church/events for details.

## Insight
1. God rescues us not by the sweat of our deeds but by the blood of His Son; grace through faith alone opens the door to eternal life.
2. Once Christ breathes new life into your heart, rise and testify in the waters of baptism; the sign belongs to those who have already begun the journey with Jesus.
3. Followers of Jesus listen before they judge, because true justice is impossible when we label enemies before hearing their story; the Cross proves God weighed every case with perfect mercy and truth.
4. The Holy Spirit stirs not riots but repentance, empowering God’s people to build, not burn; reformation replaces the spirit of lawlessness with joyful submission to Christ’s kingdom.
5. Every authority draws breath from the Father’s throne; when we honor rightful order, we proclaim that Jesus remains the ultimate Lord over earth and heaven, silencing chaos with humble obedience.
6. Stop measuring your worth by yesterday’s failures; Christ’s finished work shouts that nothing can be added to the salvation He already secured, so walk freely in the confidence of sons and daughters.
