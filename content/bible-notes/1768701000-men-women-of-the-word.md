## Introduction

* Week 3 of the "Boot Camp: Training for Team Jesus" series.

## Key Points / Exposition

### 1. You Have an Enemy

* Satan's profile: once a chief angel (Ezekiel), now the devil/diabolos (slanderer), tempter (Matthew 4).
* His mission: steal, kill, destroy.
* Typical errors: some ignore him; others open themselves to every spirit (occult, crystals, tarot). 1 John 4:1 commands discernment.
* Attack timing: when you are alone, isolated, hungry, tired (Luke 4).
* Three predictable "lures" (1 John 2:16):
    * Lust of the flesh – over-desire to feel something (food, alcohol, sex, drugs).
    * Lust of the eyes – over-desire to have something (materialism, envy).
    * Pride of life – over-desire to be something (status, applause).
* Homework: "If you were the devil, how would you take you out?" Identify your most vulnerable lure.

### 2. The Word of God—Our Only Offensive Weapon

* Armour of God (Ephesians 6:10-17): every piece is defensive except "the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God."
* Jesus' model (Luke 4): three temptations, three answers—"It is written...." (quotes Deuteronomy 6 & 8). Scripture defeats Satan.
* Nature of Scripture: 66 books, 40 writers, one divine Author whose words "will never pass away" (Matthew 24:35).
* Historic resilience: French Huguenots, Tyndale's English Bible, Voltaire's failed prediction—"Pound away, you evil hands; the hammer breaks, the anvil stands."

### 3. Grow Up and Feed Yourself

* Psalm 119:11—hide the Word in your heart to resist sin.
* Hebrews 5:12 rebuke: believers should mature from milk to solid food; spiritual "big babies" rely only on Sunday spoon-feeding.
* Especially to men/husbands: God made you the head—pick up the sword and fight for your family.

### 4. Lake Pointe Tools for Bible Saturation

* Weekly expository sermons.
* "Live Free" podcast: deeper dive every Monday (text BIBLE to 20411).
* "Rooted"—10-week discipleship boot camp teaching how to handle Scripture.
* Lake Pointe App: tap "Daily" icon for a one-chapter-a-day reading plan synced to the sermons (Mon-Fri).

## Major Lessons & Revelations

* Satan is beatable because he's predictable; Scripture is sufficient.
* For every action of the Holy Spirit, expect an opposite reaction from unholy spirits.
* Once Bible intake reaches 4+ days a week, measurable life transformation follows (study: +228% evangelism, -50% anxiety, etc.).
* God applauds progress, not perfection—when you stumble, He still says, "You're doing it!"

## Practical Application

1. Commit to at least four days of personal Bible reading this week (use the app or any plan).
2. Memorize one verse that counters your primary temptation.
3. Fathers/husbands: schedule a family Scripture time; lead the reading and prayer.
4. Register for the next Rooted session.
5. Replace occult or "spiritual" curiosities with sound Bible study; destroy any items tied to spiritism.
6. Share the "Live Free" podcast with spouse, kids, or small-group friends and discuss.

## Conclusion & Call to Response

The enemy is real, but the Word is stronger. Pick up your sword—fight for your soul, your spouse, your children, your legacy. Decide today to become a person of Scripture and prayer, and watch God reshape your lineage.

## Prayer

"Father, open our eyes to see wondrous things in Your law. Illuminate every page by Your Spirit. Make us men and women who wield the sword with skill—tearing down strongholds and protecting our families. When we fail, remind us that You cheer our first steps. Empower us as we gather this Wednesday to intercede for supernatural breakthrough. In Jesus' victorious name, Amen."

## Insights

1. Jesus won the war at the cross, so we begin our discipleship resting, not striving; trusting His finished work unlocks every step of obedience that follows.
2. The devil attacks when we feel hungry, lonely and tired, yet Jesus crushes every temptation by wielding Scripture like a sword of the Spirit. Stand firm in that same power.
3. Open your Bible more than your feed; statistical mountains move when believers engage Scripture four days a week, because God's voice rewires minds and breaks chains we thought unbreakable.
4. Fathers and mothers, you are heaven's frontline for your homes; pick up the Word and fight for your family before the enemy writes their story.
5. Even when you stumble after two steps of obedience, your Father shouts for joy because progress, not perfection, proves His Spirit is alive in you. Keep walking.
6. The Holy Spirit still leads wilderness warriors today, and He fills every prayer-soaked, Bible-saturated heart with power that overcomes darkness and blesses generations.
