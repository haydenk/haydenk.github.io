## Introduction

Pastor Josh reacts to statements made by Texas State Representative James Talarico, who self-identifies as a minister while advancing progressive positions on abortion, homosexuality, and "economic justice." Josh frames the conversation around spiritual deception, distinguishing between seekers ("refugees from the world") and intentional deceivers ("apostles of the world"). He insists the church has not drifted into politics; rather, politics has entered spiritual territory by redefining marriage, life, and gender.

## Key Points / Exposition

### 1. Two Kinds of Believers in Political Engagement

* Christian Conservatives: allegiance to Christ first; political stances flow from biblical ethics.
* Conservative Christians: allegiance to political ideology first; Christianity trimmed to fit.
* Discernment is needed to know which label truly applies to oneself.

### 2. Politics Got Spiritual, Not Vice Versa

* Government moved from basic civic tasks to moral and theological redefinitions (marriage, gender, life).
* The church's vocal response is not new politicization but defense of long-held doctrine.

### 3. Abortion: The Bible Explicitly Protects Life

* Murder prohibition (Ex 20:13) applies to unborn persons (Ps 139; Ex 21).
* Early-church writings (Didache, Barnabas, Tertullian, Chrysostom) unanimously condemn abortion.
* Redefining life to sidestep these passages is dishonest hermeneutics.

### 4. Homosexuality: Scripture Addresses Consensual Same-Sex Acts

* Leviticus 18 & 20 forbid male-male intercourse without qualifiers.
* Romans 1 describes mutual, consensual same-sex relations as evidence of societal rebellion.
* Jesus' positive definition of marriage (Mt 19) and His use of πορνεία (porneia) exclude all sexual activity outside heterosexual marriage.

### 5. "Jesus Never Mentioned It" – The Argument from Silence

* Jesus never named bestiality, incest, or nuclear war either.
* He affirmed Old-Testament morality and defined marriage, implicitly ruling out alternatives.
* Love-your-neighbor ethic forbids harming the unborn.

### 6. Greed, Generosity, and Data

* Progressive "generosity" = governmental redistribution of other people's money.
* Conservative/Christian generosity = voluntary giving of personal resources.
* Studies consistently show practicing Christians out-give secular progressives by roughly 3:1.

### 7. Justice: Competing Definitions

* Biblical justice: "equal weights and measures" (equal standards for individuals).
* Progressive justice: equal outcomes for demographic groups, achieved through unequal treatment of individuals.
* Pursuing the latter often requires actual injustice (e.g., discriminatory admissions quotas).

### 8. Kuyperian Sphere Sovereignty

* God ordains three spheres: Family (nurture/education), Church (word & sacrament), State (punish evil, reward good).
* Charity is primarily assigned to family and church, not state.
* Government social programs can unintentionally incentivize the very problems they aim to solve.

### 9. Popularity of False Teaching

* 2 Tim 4:3 forewarns of itching-ear audiences seeking teachers who justify sinful desires.
* Talarico's platform resonates because it baptizes cultural rebellion in religious language.

## Major Lessons & Revelations

* Redefinition of terms (life, marriage, justice) is a primary tactic of deception.
* Scripture must interpret culture, not vice versa.
* True generosity is sacrificial and personal, not coerced.
* The church's role in society remains prophetic: affirming truth, exposing falsehood, and loving both refugee and opponent.

## Practical Application

* Examine personal allegiance: Does my Christianity govern my politics or the reverse?
* Study primary biblical texts on life, sexuality, and justice to resist rhetorical sleight of hand.
* Practice direct generosity: budget a set percentage for benevolence and gospel work.
* Engage political issues without relinquishing biblical definitions—speak clearly in love.
* Equip oneself and one's family to recognize "equal weights and measures" vs. forced equal outcomes.

## Conclusion & Call to Response

Pastor Josh calls believers to stand firm on scriptural authority, reject deceptive redefinitions, and live out authentic generosity and justice. The cultural tide will favor teachers who tickle ears, but the church must remain rooted in timeless truth, loving refugees from the world while confronting apostles of the world with clarity and courage.

## Insight

1. Jesus remains King when politics turn spiritual; we hold the line not because we shifted, but because His unchanging Word still defines life, identity and marriage, regardless of cultural rebranding.
2. The cross welcomes refugees from the world, yet it warns apostles of the world; Christ discerns hearts and calls His church to protect the flock from deceit while extending mercy to seekers.
3. Before John the Baptist ever breathed air, he leapt for the Messiah; in that womb-sized sanctuary God affirmed personhood, declaring every preborn life precious and guarded by His command, 'You shall not murder.'
4. From Genesis to Jesus, marriage is portrayed as one man, one woman, one covenant; any alternative script falls outside the Designer's blueprint and cheats us of the gospel it portrays.
5. Generosity in Scripture flows from Spirit-moved hearts, not state mandates; we give freely because Christ first gave Himself, trusting His grace to multiply bread and mercy beyond bureaucratic reach.
6. In days when itching ears gather smooth talkers, the Spirit urges us to hold fast; sound doctrine is not cruelty but the lifeline that keeps wandering souls from drowning in deception.
