## Gathering Information

* Live, online snow-day study from Josh & Jana Howerton's home ("Howerton Casa"), Dallas-area, early Feb 2023
* Interactive stream across multiple platforms; comments fed to leader in real time

## Scripture References

* Luke 5:1-11
* Luke 6:12-16
* John 21:1-19
* James 5:16
* Proverbs 27:17
* Proverbs 12:18
* Proverbs 13:20
* Matthew 5:29-30
* Romans 8:1-3
* 2 Peter 1:3
* 2 Corinthians 6:14
* 1 Peter 1:13

## Introduction

* Snow and ice cancelled in-person services, so the Howertons invited everyone into their living room for a "life-group style" Bible study.
* Viewers asked to grab Bibles, coffee, and drop comments (location, snow-day activities, questions).
* Light-hearted moments: showing a newly mounted gemsbok, naming suggestions ("Zulu," "Howie," "Paul").
* Celebrations shared:
  * 7,148 people at Night of Prayer & Worship (Rockwall campus)
  * Two volunteers (John Mixon & Kelly Vrooman) got engaged that night
  * Healing testimony: Jackson, 19, 18-months free of fentanyl, instant relief from 10/10 back pain
  * Jana's ongoing ministry to couples battling infertility

## Key Points

### 1. Central Thesis

A disciple of Jesus "assembles a band of brothers or sisters." If Jesus did, we must.

### 2. Text Work - Luke 5 & 6

* Luke 5: Peter's call: empty nets, miraculous catch, new identity as "fisher of men."
* Luke 6:12-16: after all-night prayer, Jesus *chooses* twelve very different men.
* Connection to John 21: After Peter's failure, Jesus recreates the Luke 5 scene (boat, empty nets, overflowing catch) to restore him—proof that calling survives failure.

### 3. Four Relationship Windows (adapted from the Johari Window)

| Quadrant | Who Knows? | Need | Biblical Tie-in |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Arena | I know / You know | Fellowship | Acts 2 community |
| Mask | I know / You don't | Confidential confession | James 5:16 |
| Blind-Spot | You know / I don't | Honest feedback | Proverbs 27:17 |
| Potential | Only God knows | Spirit-empowered community to call it out | 2 Peter 1:3 (plural "you") |

### 4. Why Many Never Grow

* Keeping the *mask* on (= hiding sin); fungus grows in the dark.
* No one deputized to speak to *blind spots*.
* Isolation from the body; missing resources God located in *other believers*.

### 5. "Radical Amputation" of Wrong Relationships

* Matthew 5 hyperbole—cut off anything that drags you into sin.
* 2 Corinthians 6:14—closest bonds must be with committed believers.
* Parents: **you** choose young kids' friends (Proverbs 13:20).

### 6. Gender-Specific Obstacles

* Women: settling for the wrong community; reluctance to be known; busyness; perfectionism; unrealistic dependence on friends rather than Christ.
* Men: tendency to have *no* close community; prefer shoulder-to-shoulder mission; need to initiate around shared activity.

### 7. On-Ramps at Lake Point

* Ten-week "Rooted" experience = easiest place to form a band.
* Text "ROOTED" to 20411 to enroll.

## Theological / Exegetical Points

* Five names for Sea of Galilee; Luke calls it "Lake of Gennesaret."
* Three men named James in the NT.
* John 21 deliberately mirrors Luke 5 to reaffirm Peter's calling.
* Salvation vs. healing in confession: confess to God for *forgiveness*, to believers for *healing* (James 5:16).

## Interaction & Group Responses

* Hundreds posted locations (South Africa, France, Alberta, Fargo at -18 °F, etc.).
* Group suggested names for the gemsbok; voted on "Paul."
* Viewers dropped live questions (cremation, Nephilim, Mormonism, parenting, anxiety).
* Quick-fire answers given; 30 Live Free hats promised to random commenters typing "hat."

## Practical Applications

1. Identify which "window" you lack; ask God who should fill it.
2. Confess a hidden struggle to one trustworthy believer this week.
3. Deputize 2-4 same-gender friends to point out blind spots.
4. Evaluate friendships; if needed, lovingly "amputate" ties that sabotage holiness.
5. Parents: actively curate your children's closest companions.
6. Married couples: weekly date night, daily connection, annual getaway.
7. Men: launch relationships around mission (work project, fishing, golf) + insert Scripture/prayer.
8. Women: move from "cheer-only" circles to iron-sharpening ones; share your own needs.
9. Enroll in Rooted; everyone is "new" there.

## Prayer / Intercession Items

* Gratitude for Night of Prayer & Worship and for Jackson's healing.
* Blessing on engaged couple John Mixon & Kelly Vrooman.
* Continued miracles for couples facing infertility; Jana's ministry.
* Courage for viewers to join or form authentic bands and to sever harmful ties.
* Safety and warmth for all during the ice storm.

## Next Meeting / Future Arrangements

* Live Free podcast episode (deep dive on Luke 5/6, Nephilim, Mormonism) releases noon today; text "PODCAST" to 20411 for link.
* Rooted Spring session starts soon—signup via "ROOTED" to 20411.
* 30 Live Free hats to be mailed to randomly selected "hat" commenters.

## Insights

1. Jesus still crosses every barrier to reclaim wandering hearts; remember how He walked eighty miles to meet Peter at Galilee, proving that no distance can mute the Shepherd's restoring love.
2. At the cross Christ took your guilt; now Romans shouts, "no condemnation!" Step out of hiding, because your darkest failure is only tinder for God's blazing grace.
3. Scripture says confess to one another and pray, so healing may flow; dare to drop the mask, for sin dies quickly when dragged into Christ's light with friends.
4. Isolation dulls faith, but shared mission sharpens it; assemble believers who worship, work, and war beside you, because iron only sparks when it strikes another blade.
5. When anxiety storms, anchor in the Father's affection; breathe His name, recall His promises, until perfect love drives out every trembling fear.
6. God equips the body with graces we lack alone; lean into Spirit-filled community and discover that together we have everything required for life and godliness.
