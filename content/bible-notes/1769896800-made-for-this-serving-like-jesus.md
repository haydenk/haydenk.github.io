## Scripture References

* Mark 10:42–45
* Isaiah 58:5–10
* 1 Peter 2:9
* 1 Peter 4:10
* 1 Corinthians 12:4–27

## Introduction

* The preacher (Breaux) greets the congregation in the New Year and promotes the "Rooted" discipleship experience as a next step for everyone—from skeptics to seasoned believers.
* He frames the current sermon series as "Boot Camp," a practical training in living the life of Jesus. Previous weeks covered baptism, Spirit-dependence, truth, and community; today's theme is serving.
* Personal mission statement written at age 25: "I just want to look, love, and live like Jesus." Serving is indispensable to that pursuit.

## Key Points / Exposition

### 1. "Not So With You" – The Call to Serve (Mark 10:42–45)

* Context: James and John ("Sons of Thunder") request seats of honor; disciples grumble.
* Jesus contrasts worldly power plays with kingdom greatness: greatness = servanthood, first = slave of all.
* Four-word kingdom ethic: "Not so with you." Ambition, ladder-climbing, credential-flashing—off-limits for Jesus-followers.

### 2. Service and Human Flourishing – What Research Confirms

* University of Chicago study: Most fulfilling jobs involve teaching, caring, protecting, or otherwise serving; income level had minimal impact on happiness once basic needs were met.
* Oxford meta-analysis (40 studies, 20 years): Consistent volunteers enjoy lower depression, stress, heart disease; higher fulfillment.
* Youth data: Serving teens have less substance abuse, fewer unplanned pregnancies, higher self-esteem; parents should even "require" volunteering for their good.
* Conclusion: "As long as you're all about you, you'll never be happy."

### 3. Two Seas, Two Lives – Illustration from Israel

* Geography: Snowmelt from Mt. Hermon → Jordan River → Sea of Galilee (alive) → Jordan → Dead Sea (lifeless).
* Spiritual parallel: Galilee receives and gives; Dead Sea only receives. A giving life teems with joy; a hoarding life stagnates.

### 4. The Priestly People – Every Member a Minister (1 Peter 2:9)

* Historical drift: Churches hired "professional Christians" while members spectated, a model absent from Scripture.
* New-covenant reality: All believers are a "royal priesthood" with direct access to God and a mandate to declare His praises.
* Pentecost (Acts 2) affirms Spirit distributed to "ordinary" people, not an elite few.

### 5. Spiritual Gifts – Distributed, Diverse, Dependent (1 Cor 12; 1 Pet 4:10)

* Definition: A spiritual gift is a supernatural ability given to each believer to advance God's purposes together.
* The Spirit decides the gift mix (1 Cor 12:11). No A-list or B-list gifts—each part matters.
* Analogy of the body: unseen parts are as necessary as visible ones; when one part hurts, all hurt; when one flourishes, all rejoice (1 Cor 12:24–27).
* Practical discovery:
  * Personality (introvert/extrovert, head/heart).
  * Talents/skills honed over years.
  * Life experiences (successes, wounds, recoveries).
  * Passion "that flips your switch."
  * Combine these with the spiritual gift for maximum impact.

### 6. Stories that Illustrate

* Heather, a young volunteer with the gift of mercy, became "pastor" to a family in ICU—proof that clergy are not the only priests.
* "Toenail" friend: gladly served behind the scenes for 30 years, signing every note "Toenail" to affirm small but crucial service.
* Rapid-fire imagined testimonies (John, Deshawna, Jeremy, Emma, Maria, Roberto, Samantha, Dustin, Alvis, Tyler) show the variety of gifts: mercy, administration, helps, evangelism, leadership, encouragement, hospitality, artistry, intercession, humor.

## Major Lessons & Revelations

* Greatness in God's kingdom is measured by servanthood, not status.
* Joy and health follow a life lived beyond self; secular research echoes Jesus' words.
* God's design for the church is a fully activated body where every believer-priest deploys Spirit-given gifts.
* Diversity of gifts is intentional and beautiful; comparison and envy cripple the body.

## Practical Application

1. Identify your gift mix: reflect on personality, abilities, experiences, passions; take a spiritual-gifts assessment if helpful.
2. Engage regularly: text "SERVE" to 20411, visit the lobby tent, or sign up for "Rooted" (QR code card) to connect gifts with needs.
3. Start small today:
   * Ask "Who can I serve before day's end?"
   * Adopt a weekly rhythm of volunteering (church, school, shelter, neighbor).
   * Model service for children; involve them in tangible acts.
4. Guard your heart: reject comparison; receive your unique assignment with gratitude.
5. Sustain the flow: like the Sea of Galilee, maintain an "outlet" by giving time, talent, and treasure continuously.

## Conclusion & Call to Response

The happiest, most fulfilled people are those who echo Jesus: "I came not to be served but to serve." Step out of the bleachers and onto the field—discover why you were "made for this." Join the mission, activate your gift, and let God's generosity flow through you.

## Prayer

"Jesus, thank You for ransoming us through Your self-giving love. Shape us into servants who accurately reflect You—eyes open to needs, hearts humble, hands ready. Empower each gift, small or large, visible or hidden, so Your light floods a hurting world. Amen."

## Insights

1. When the world tells you to climb the ladder, Jesus whispers, “Not so with you—greatness is found on your knees, serving the least.” Walk that humble path and taste heaven’s true joy.
2. God wired your heart uniquely, and the Spirit placed a supernatural gift inside you so the church can shine; dare to deploy it and discover how pouring yourself out fills you fuller than ever.
3. The Father never intended a few professionals to carry His mission; He calls every believer a royal priest, saying, “Everyone gets in on it, everyone benefits—come out of the bleachers and serve.”
4. Like the Jordan flowing through Galilee, life flourishes where generosity has an outlet; become that river for your neighborhood and watch Jesus delight in you, because the Dead Sea of self-focus can never birth joy.
5. Research merely echoes Scripture: communion and compassion heal the heart; so lock arms with friends and strangers, trusting that the Spirit will turn every act of service into medicine for your own soul.
6. Because Jesus ransomed us, the measure of our days is not what we’ve gathered but whom we’ve lifted; awaken this morning resolved that serving one person today is worship the Father treasures.
