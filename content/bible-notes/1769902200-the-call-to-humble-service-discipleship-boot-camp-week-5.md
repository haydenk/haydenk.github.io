## Gathering Information

* Leader: Charles (teaching); Mark (will lead closing prayer)
* Time note: Charles needed to leave by 6:20 p.m. for the opening of "Rooted."

## Scripture References

* Luke 22:24–30

## Introduction

* Opening reminder that the 10-week "Rooted" discipleship course begins tonight; next session begins in ~18 weeks.
* Session aim: expose our default instinct to protect personal status and contrast it with Jesus' call to humble service.
* Warm-up: rapid-fire everyday scenarios (potluck line, last slice of pizza, four-way stop, credit for work, etc.) to surface personal instincts.

## Key Points

1. Human Instinct vs. Kingdom Posture
   * Most of us naturally guard our place ("If you ain't first, you're last").
   * Jesus redefines greatness by servanthood, not status.
2. Context of Luke 22:
   * Conversation occurs during the Last Supper, right after Jesus announces His betrayal and institutes Communion.
   * Disciples still argue over who is greatest, revealing deep-seated worldly thinking.
3. Jesus' Teaching (vv. 25-27):
   * Earthly rulers wield power and call themselves "benefactors."
   * "It is not this way with you." Greatness = becoming "the youngest" and "the one who serves."
   * Jesus models it: "I am among you as the one who serves."
4. Future Honor (vv. 28-30):
   * Faithfulness in trials will be rewarded with seats at Jesus' table and authority in the coming Kingdom.
   * Present obedience is never wasted; reward is relational, not rivalrous.
5. Rewiring Our Definition of Success
   * Greatness measured by posture, not position.
   * Actions change only after mindset and identity change.

## Theological / Exegetical Points

* "Benefactors" (v. 25): leaders who style themselves as public benefactors while actually exercising control.
* Youngest/servant imagery: those with no social leverage, authority, or claim to honor.
* Servanthood encapsulates Jesus' entire mission; no one forced Him—He chose it.
* Faithfulness, endurance, and hidden obedience carry eternal significance; self-promotion does not.

## Interaction & Group Responses

* Potluck line: some wait, others "break the ice."
* Last slice of pizza: most defer; one joyfully takes it.
* Four-way stop: varying tactics from cautious observation to "never stopping."
* Taking credit: several would stay silent; one would confide in his wife.
* Meeting disagreement: mixed—press the point vs. let it go.
* Discussion revealed universal pull toward recognition, respect, and hierarchy.
* Story from Anthony: serving family while grumbling; Holy Spirit reminds him to "do it as unto the Lord," bringing immediate peace.
* Respect vs. authenticity debate: genuine challenge from brothers is a form of respect.

## Practical Applications

1. Examine personal "status-protecting" reflexes revealed in everyday choices.
2. Adopt Jesus' strategy: pursue hidden, voluntary service; elevate others.
3. Write down one concrete next step in phone (exercise done in class). Possibilities:
   * Join a service team (classroom, church, community).
   * Begin "Rooted," Next-Step class, fasting, Bible reading plan, recovery ministry.
   * Reconcile a relationship; practice sacrificial giving; consider baptism or salvation decision.
4. Evaluate gifting overlap (natural talents + spiritual gifts) to locate best place of service.
5. Remember: seeking status never satisfies; servanthood brings freedom and lasting honor.

## Next Meeting / Future Arrangements

* Next week: Josh will teach; Mark will follow with a session on giving.
* "Rooted" runs for 10 weeks; new round begins in about 18 weeks for those wait-listed.

## Insights

1. When Jesus picked up the towel at the Last Supper, He rewrote greatness; the King became the servant so we could trade our craving for status for the joy of humble love.
2. Your hidden acts of kindness are never wasted; the Father sees in secret, and He turns unseen faithfulness into eternal honor that outshines every podium, title, or applause this passing world offers.
3. The Spirit unhooks our hearts from the ladder of self-promotion, whispering that greatness is measured by posture, not position; choose the lower seat and watch His power lift others through you.
4. Because Christ stooped to wash dusty feet, we are free to leave entitlement behind and serve; freedom flows from surrender, not status, and the Kingdom blooms wherever humble hands meet hidden needs.
5. If Jesus can entrust thrones to disciples who bickered over rank, He can redeem our misdirected ambition; faithfulness today shapes eternal influence tomorrow, so persevere in unseen service and let Heaven keep score.
6. Stop refreshing your social feed for validation; look at the cross where the Son of God took last place and hear Him invite you to the only table where servants become sons forever.
