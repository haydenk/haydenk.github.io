## Introduction

* Pastor opens with testimony of gospel impact in Iran--average of ten daily baptisms amid persecution; calls congregation to remember persecuted believers (Heb 13:3).
* Series context: "Boot Camp--Training for Team Jesus," nearing final week; today's focus is money and stewardship.
* Reads Luke 19:11-27 (parable of the minas) while congregation stands in reverence.
* Explains prophetic backdrop: Jesus' approach to Jerusalem, prediction of temple destruction (Luke 19:44) fulfilled in A.D. 70; therefore His future promises--including judgment and reward--are certain.

## Key Points / Exposition

### 1. I Am a Steward, Not an Owner

* Definition: A steward manages another's property; nothing truly "belongs" to us--everything is on loan from God (Ps 24:1).
* False mind-sets
  * "What's mine is mine" = selfishness.
  * "What's yours is mine" = stealing (or forced redistribution).
  * Disciple's mind-set: "What's mine is God's."
* Illustrations
  * Death rate is 100%--possessions will outlast us, ending up at yard/estate sales.
  * Parent-child analogy: kids claim rooms, money, jeans--but parents own the house; likewise, we live in God's house and use His resources.
* Practical conviction: homes, incomes, talents, even life itself ultimately belong to God.

### 2. Stewards Do the Master's Will

* Parable contrast:
  * Servant #1--1 mina to 10 minas; commended and given rule over ten cities.
  * Servant #2--1 mina to 5 minas; rewarded proportionally.
  * Servant #3--fearfully hides mina; called "wicked and lazy."
* Faithful stewardship centers on giving God the first and best ("firstfruits")--the biblical tithe (Lev 27:30; Prov 3:9-10).
  * Tithe = 10% and it is the first 10%, not the leftovers.
  * Giving first demonstrates faith; it costs nothing to give the last.
* "Ten" as a test in Scripture (plagues, commandments, wilderness tests, etc.). Every paycheck tests whom we trust and enthrone.
* "King of the Hill" analogy: only one can occupy the throne of the heart (Mt 6:24). Where our treasure is, our heart follows.

### 3. God Gives More to People Who Know What the "More" Is For

* In the parable, resources flow toward the proven stewards; even the fearful servant's mina is reassigned.
* Principle: God does not primarily give according to need, want, or even prayer alone, but according to stewardship capacity.
* Clarification: This is not the prosperity gospel.
  * We don't "give to get" luxury; we give to please the Father.
  * Prosperity teaching uses God to love money; biblical stewardship uses money to love God.
* Scriptural promises of provision for faithful givers (Lk 6:38; Mal 3:10; Prov 3:9-10).
* Personal testimony: Pastor's parents tithed while below the poverty line and experienced timely provision--instilling a legacy, "You'll never be able to afford to tithe until you tithe... when you return the first to God, the rest is blessed."
* 90% with God > 100% without God; congregation invited to witness raised hands affirming God's faithfulness.

## Major Lessons & Revelations

* God owns everything; we are temporary managers.
* Fear of scarcity disables obedience; faith releases multiplication.
* Stewardship decisions now determine eternal commendation or loss.
* Generosity trains hearts--and future generations--to walk by faith, not by sight.
* Movements move: our obedience fuels global gospel advance, even in persecuted places like Iran.

## Practical Application

* Audit heart posture: Identify any area where "mine" overrides "God's."
* Budget with God first--automate the tithe before subscriptions or discretionary spending.
* Teach children early: give from every allowance, gift, or paycheck.
* Replace fear narratives ("I won't have enough") with faith declarations from Scripture.
* Remember and intercede for persecuted believers; let global mission shape financial priorities.

## Conclusion & Call to Response

* Choice before every believer: embrace the role of faithful steward or remain a fearful, "wicked and lazy" servant.
* Invitation to step into first-fruit giving, trust God's character, and secure eternal "well done."
* Legacy challenge to parents and grandparents: model faith-filled generosity as the greatest inheritance.

## Prayer

* Pastor asks the Holy Spirit to displace fear with sonship, empower obedience, and release generational blessing through faith-filled giving: "No spirit but the Holy Spirit--lead us to put You first in all things."

## Insights

1. Even under hostile regimes, King Jesus is gathering a harvest in Iran, baptizing souls daily; our prayers link us to their courage as one worldwide body of Christ, proclaiming His unstoppable gospel.
2. The Father owns every breath and dollar we touch; when we recognize ourselves as stewards, generosity becomes worship instead of loss, and our hearts finally rest in His limitless provision.
3. Because God first loved us through Christ's costly gift, we honor Him with first fruits; faith writes His name on the top line of every budget and trusts Him to bless the remaining ninety percent.
4. Jesus is returning as the just Nobleman, and He will reward faithfulness; every resource in my hand today is a rehearsal for eternity's accounting, so I invest boldly in His kingdom now.
5. Only one master fits on the throne of a human heart; when Christ reigns, money becomes a servant instead of a tyrant, freeing us to live fearless and eternally minded lives.
6. The Holy Spirit still puts supernatural stretch on natural resources; families that plant seeds of faithful giving will reap testimonies richer than any earthly inheritance, proving that our Father loves to outgive His children.
