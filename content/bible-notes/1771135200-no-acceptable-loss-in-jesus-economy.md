## Scripture References

* Luke 15:1-7

## Introduction

The leader opened with real-life examples of "acceptable loss"--a 2% inventory shrinkage in his retail business, underperforming investments, parental advice that "goes in one ear and out the other," errant golf shots, jokes that fall flat, and time that slips away. He asked:

1. Where do you personally allow loss?
2. At what point does a loss stop bothering you?

Group members suggested thresholds based on profit margins, emotional investment, or right intentions, but admitted the standards are usually arbitrary.

## Key Points

Full passage read aloud:

"Now the tax collectors and sinners were all gathering around to hear Jesus. But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, 'This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.' Then Jesus told them this parable: 'Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesn't he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it? And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, "Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep." I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.'"

## Insights

1. Jesus shows us a kingdom where profit sheets don't matter; He leaves the ninety-nine secure to track down one straying heart, because not a single soul is an "acceptable loss" to Him.
2. When even one weary sinner turns for home, heaven erupts louder than over ninety-nine steady saints, for God's heart throws its biggest party at every single moment of repentance.
3. Critics mutter from the back row, yet Jesus disarms them with a story instead of a quarrel, proving that divine wisdom rescues the lost more powerfully than human arguments ever will.
4. We accept shrinkage in business, relationships and time, but the Shepherd's balance sheet is different, because He invests limitless grace until every scattered sheep is safely carried on His shoulders.
5. As recipients of that relentless search, we're called to mirror the Shepherd, walking into open country and broken neighborhoods, trusting that the Holy Spirit still guides us toward the one heart heaven longs to rescue.
6. Celebrate boldly; invite friends and neighbors to rejoice, just as the Shepherd did, because sharing salvation stories multiplies joy on earth and echoes the celebration already roaring above.
