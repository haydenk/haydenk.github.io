## Introduction

* Marriage Weekend launched with light-hearted giveaways, prayer for couples, and a clear warning that the message would be candid about marital intimacy.
* Sets stage for new series "Investigating Jesus," beginning with society's top question: What did Jesus teach about gender, marriage, divorce, and sexuality?
* Pastor frames marriage as a primary spiritual battleground -- strong families produce generational disciples.

## Key Points / Exposition

### 1. Marriage: From Garden to Glory

* Bible opens with a wedding (Adam & Eve, Genesis 2) and closes with a wedding (Lamb & Church, Revelation 19).
* Satan appears immediately after the first wedding (Genesis 3), signaling that he targets marriages to thwart godly offspring (Malachi 2).
* Application: Your spouse is not your enemy; you have a common enemy who wants to turn "husband and wife" into "husband versus wife."

### 2. The Authority Question: "Have You Not Read?"

* Jesus answers Pharisees' divorce test by appealing to Scripture, not culture (Matthew 19:4).
* Contrast: God's plan (Word) blesses; Satan's plan (world) curses.
* Modern statistics confirm biblical wisdom: church-attending, Bible-believing couples show far lower adultery and divorce rates and report the most satisfying intimacy.

### 3. God's Design for Marriage

* Creator "made them male and female ... a man shall leave ... be united ... and the two shall become one flesh" (Matthew 19:4-6).
* Design features:
  * One biological man + one biological woman.
  * Leave parents, cleave to spouse, become one.
  * Covenant, not contract -- what God joined, humans must not sever.
* Practical "oneness" arenas: shared home, bed, last name, bank account, values, mission.

### 4. Three Easy Ways to Kill Your Marriage

1. Prioritize career (often men) or children (often women) above spouse.
2. Elevate parents or in-laws over spouse -- failure to "leave" prevents "cleave."
3. Live as takers, not servants -- marriages become battles (two takers) or abuse (one giver, one taker) instead of blessings (two servants, Ephesians 5:21).

### 5. Understanding Divorce & Remarriage

* Jesus' "exception clause" -- sexual immorality may permit (not command) divorce (Matthew 19:9).
* Paul's abandonment clause -- if an unbelieving spouse deserts, the believer "is not bound" (1 Corinthians 7:15).
* Abuse: persistent, tangible harm requires immediate safety; separation (and often civil/legal action) is warranted.
* Remarriage: where God permits divorce, He permits remarriage; otherwise repent, seek forgiveness, honor current covenant.
* Church posture: hate divorce, love divorced people; offer mercy and restoration.

### 6. Legacy Matters

* Max Jukes vs. Jonathan Edwards family trees illustrate how one marriage decision influences generations -- brokenness or blessing.

## Major Lessons & Revelations

* Scripture, not societal opinion, is the reliable blueprint for flourishing marriages.
* Oneness is holistic -- spiritual, emotional, physical, financial, relational.
* Servanthood is the oxygen of a thriving marriage; selfishness suffocates it.
* God's grace can resurrect dead marriages just as surely as He raised Christ.
* Your marital choices today shape descendants you may never meet.

## Practical Application

1. Daily choose Scripture over social media for marital counsel.
2. Schedule a weekly "oneness check-in": ask "How can I serve you this week? I love you because...".
3. Re-order priorities: God to Spouse to Children to Vocation/Ministry to Extended Family.
4. If cohabiting or in sexual sin, text "MARRIAGE" to 20411; church will help legalize covenant this week.
5. Attend Next Steps class (text "NEXT" to 20411) to grow as disciples.
6. Seek counseling or safe separation immediately if abuse is present -- church will assist with authorities and care.

## Conclusion & Call to Response

* Invitation to high faith: sitting under God's Word sets miracles in motion.
* Couples urged to repent, forgive, and speak fresh "I'm sorry / I forgive you."
* Individuals undecided about Christ challenged to trust, not test, Jesus.
* Commitment: "We have decided to be one; by God's grace nothing will separate us."

## Prayer

* "Father, renew minds and marriages; restore what Satan has broken; give open hearts that hear and obey. Make every couple a testimony of Your redeeming power for their lives, lineage, and legacy. In Jesus' name, Amen."

## Insights

1. Strong families start when a husband and wife cling to Christ and to each other, because the moment they say 'I do,' hell trembles at their unity and heaven releases generational blessing.
2. Every marriage faces two blueprints -- the world's shaky opinions or God's solid Word; when couples choose Scripture as their compass, the Spirit builds a house no storm can collapse.
3. Because Jesus rose, no relationship is beyond resurrection; two sinners can become new creations, forgiving and forgiven, so that a dead marriage walks out of the tomb alive with hope.
4. God's design is simple: leave, cleave, become one; when spouses prize each other above careers, kids and culture, the unity they guard becomes a living sermon their children cannot ignore.
5. Satan whispers, 'be normal,' yet normal is broken; Jesus calls us higher, and when we obey His counter-cultural commands, peace replaces chaos like light flooding a once-dark room.
6. When couples join hands and pray, surrendering their story to the Father, they set a miracle in motion that ripples through grandchildren they have not yet met.
